# by :13.0.1 at least, alpine-node started coming with old versions of chromium and mongodb installed
# No luck upgrading or uninstalling them, and they were breaking testcafe and cleanup_dev_dbs.sh respectively
# 12.9.0 was the previous image I built from/knew to be good, not necessarily the latest pre-funny buisness
# ... can't stay locked to this forever though
# The problem really only effected the container used for testing, but keeping build locked to the same version for consistency
