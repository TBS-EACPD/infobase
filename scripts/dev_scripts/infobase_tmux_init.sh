  # steps:
  #  - split, with working window to the left, area for watch scripts on the right
  #  - start installing client packages in window that will run client webpack
  #  - open window for client server. Keep trying (with delay) to run until serve works, as installation above may not have finished yet
  #  - split window vertically to make window for local API server, start installing API server packages
  #  - move back to client server window, need to open windows in jumbled order to get desired layout
  #  - open window for client base build to the right of the client server window, keep trying to start as client packages may still be installing
  #  - move back to API server window
  #  - open window for mongod
  #  - to the right of mongod, open window for API populate_db process, keep trying to start it as the API packages may still be installing
