Potential doc topics:
  - directory/project structure
  - assumptions we make (data's read-only, redeploys when the function deploys, function deploys in sync with client deploys etc.)
  - tips and best practices
    - offloading work to populate-time
    - considerations for the mongo schema, when to nest vs flatten? Duplicating data?
    - working with dataloaders
    - balancing a nice/clean schema against an efficient API for the client's actual needs
  - use of snapshot tests
