This qualitative indicator will assess the overall effectiveness of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) in conducting international operations using standardized criteria for success. The report will demonstrate key successes and challenges for international operations based on an overall assessment of key requirements. A lack of effectiveness in the conduct of international operations is a critical indicator of the CAF’s ability to meet its core mission. This high-level indicator could identify requirements to adjust military planning, capacity or capability within the dynamic operational environment. Such information will assist the DND/CAF in making resource allocation decisions for training demands and future force development. In addition, it will inform future mission planning requirements and objective setting, and will provide insight into concurrent operation capacity.  
 
Formula/calculation:  
Subject matter experts assess each operation's critical tasks against established assessment criteria (e.g. critical tasks fulfilled by personnel with the requisite skills and required equipment, logistically sustained, including communications systems that enable effective command and control), to derive successes and challenges which informs further assessment to what extent desired effects and objectives are being or will be achieved. A cross-functional working group validates assessments; and identifies and aggregates key successes, challenges, trends and themes; enabling the production of a qualitative assessment for international operations writ large.  A senior-level Review Board validates respective mission assessments and approves a qualitative narrative.

This indicator assesses the Canadian Armed Forces' (CAF) ability to meet the directed objectives of international operations, through effects created by the execution of directed and funded critical tasks. It assists in determining the effects of international deployments and defence commitments. This indicator will help the CAF to assess whether adequate resources are attributed to the operations, whether assets are properly prepared, and whether plans, objectives and approaches require adjustment to ensure future success.  If a critical task cannot be completed, information will be gathered for consultation and analysis for the purpose of providing insight into issues, implications and recommendations.

This indicator illustrates the ability of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) to respond to Government of Canada aeronautical SAR requests. This indicator measures the percentage of aeronautical SAR mission requests fulfilled by CAF annually. The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) will task CAF assets for mandated aeronautical Search and Rescue (SAR) cases as appropriate. Not every case, however, requires a response by CAF aeronautical assets (for instance, when an asset from another organization is closer and available to respond). Tracking the number of SAR aeronautical responses fulfilled by the CAF against those tasked demonstrates the necessity of CAF SAR capability, the CAF’s capacity to respond (e.g. serviceability of aircraft), the nature of the operating environment (e.g. inability to safely respond due to weather conditions), and the frequency of occurrence. A low response rate to requests for SAR assistance could indicate challenges in the CAF's ability to provide a SAR capability in order to meet GC expectations.

This qualitative indicator will assess the overall effectiveness of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) in conducting continental operations using standardized criteria for success. The report will demonstrate key successes and challenges for continental operations based on an overall assessment of key requirements. A lack of effectiveness in the conduct of continental operations is a critical indicator of the CAF’s ability to meet its core mission. This high-level indicator could identify requirements to adjust military planning, capacity or capability within the dynamic operational environment.  Such information will assist the DND/CAF in making resource allocation decisions for training demands and future force development. In addition, it will inform future mission planning requirements and objective setting, and will provide insight into concurrent operation capacity. 
Formula/calculation:  
Subject matter experts assess each operation's critical tasks against established assessment criteria (e.g. critical tasks fulfilled by personnel with the requisite skills and required equipment, logistically sustained, including via communications systems that enable effective command and control), to derive successes and challenges which informs further assessment to what extent desired effects and objectives are being or will be achieved. A cross-functional working group validates assessments; and, identifies and aggregates key successes, challenges, trends and themes; enabling the production of a qualitative assessment report for Operations in North America writ large.  A senior-level Review Board validates respective mission assessments and approves a qualitative narrative.

The CAF reaches that goal by attracting, processing, selecting, transferring, and enrolling an adequate # of high-quality internal and external applicants to meet the CAF’s personnel needs and the needs of the various occupations. The efforts made by the people in charge of the program to attract applicants are aimed at ensuring that the CAF reflects the diversity of the country that it defends (Strong, Secure, Engaged, p. 20) as a result of increased awareness of employment opportunities for members of under represented groups within the CAF, including, but not limited to, women, Aboriginals and visible minorities (Strong, Secure, Engaged, p. 23). Through active external marketing and advertising campaigns, the people in charge of the program intend to position the CAF as an employer of choice and meet the personnel needs established by the Government of Canada (GC).

The needs of members and their families will evolve throughout their careers and so too must the services and support on which they rely.

National Defence must build a Defence Team “that looks like Canada,” reflecting the diversity of the country it defends. National Defence is committed to the development of a Diversity Strategy and Action Plan, the implementation of which will be overseen by a Diversity Champion, with a stated objective of reinforcing diversity in the identity of the Defence Team and its doctrine. A cornerstone of meeting this objective is the recruiting and retention of under-represented populations within the Defence Team, including visible minorities. Under the Employment Equity Act, National Defence is required to reflect a similar level of participation by visible minorities as that found in the broader labour market. The indicator will directly support the assessment of compliance with our obligations under the Employment Equity Act. 
It is imperative that the Defence Team reflects the increasing diversity of the population it serves. Diversity improves operational flexibility and effectiveness.  Failure to achieve this could impact our ability to operate in an increasingly complex world. Further, the Defence Team must meet its legal obligations under the Employment Equity Act. 
If the number of visible minorities employed by the Defence Team remains static or is lower than the target contemplated by the Employment Equity Act, it would inform decision makers to undertake programmes to improve recruitment and retention of visible minorities in the Defence Team.

This indicator shows the percentage of the Canadian general youth population (12-18 years old) that actively participates in the Cadets and Junior Canadian Rangers Youth Programmes. The information is segmented to show, as a minimum, the sex and age of participants. A decreased participation rate will negatively affect the program's capacity to develop youth leaders. This indicator will identify participation trends and inform annual and forecasted performance requirements. It will also act as an early warning mechanism of potential attraction, retention or overall satisfaction issues with the program if participation rates fall well below targets.

National Defence must build a Defence Team “that looks like Canada,” reflecting the diversity of the country it defends. National Defence is committed to the development of a Diversity Strategy and Action Plan, the implementation of which will be overseen by a Diversity Champion, with a stated objective of reinforcing diversity in the identity of the Defence Team and its doctrine. A cornerstone of meeting this objective is the recruiting and retention of under-represented populations within the Defence Team, including visible minorities. Under the Employment Equity Act, National Defence is required to reflect a similar level of participation by visible minorities as that found in the broader labour market. The indicator will directly support the assessment of compliance with our obligations under the Employment Equity Act. 
It is imperative that the Defence Team reflects the increasing diversity of the population it serves. Diversity improves operational flexibility and effectiveness.  Failure to achieve this could impact our ability to operate in an increasingly complex world. Further, the Defence Team must meet its legal obligations under the Employment Equity Act.

The Department of National Defence is committed to leadership in gender balance, and to the integration of Gender Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) in all defence activities. A cornerstone of this policy is the recruitment and retention of under-represented populations, including women. Under the Employment Equity Act, the Department of National Defence must reflect a similar level of participation by women as that found in the broader labour market. The indicator will directly support assessment of DND compliance with the Employment Equity Act. 
The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) must reflect the diversity of the population it serves. Diversity improves operational flexibility and effectiveness due to the incorporation of diverse points of view and experiences into our approach to operations. The CAF leverages the expanded understanding, awareness, and opportunities drawn from diverse perspectives when overcoming challenges at home and abroad. Failure to achieve this diversity will limit the potential for positive cultural change and future operational effectiveness. Further, we must meet our legal obligations under the Employment Equity Act. If the number of women employed by the Defence Team does not meet the targets contemplated by the Employment Equity Act, decision makers would know to undertake programmes to increase the number of women in the Defence Team.

This indicator provides information on the extent of reported incidents of Harmful and Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour (HISB) and sexual misconduct involving Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and National Defence civilian personnel. The tracking of the number of reported incidents in the Defence Team help the Department to develop and evolve its support, education, and prevention plans to address harassment and HISB. An increase in reports could indicate an increase in incidents (negative trend) or an increase in awareness and confidence in leadership (positive trend).

Incidents that involve National Defence civilian personnel are collected through Human Resource Management System logs.

This indicator illustrates the degree to which Science and Technology (S&T) and innovation (STI) are integrated into the Department and contribute to enabling and shaping Defence and Security decisions and operations. S&T plays a critical role in contributing to Canada’s defence and national security, providing the knowledge and technological advantage necessary to develop the required military capabilities for future operations. Defence and Security S&T is an essential enabler to ensure operational relevance, to address threats from potential adversaries, and to maintain operational compatibility alongside key allies. Low performance in this area would have critically negative effects on the aforementioned capabilities and decrease the Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to adapt to a changing threat environment. Obtained results will indicate requirements to harmonize National Defence initiatives with STI programs, develop STI programs that address defence requirements (as validated by stakeholders), and ensure a departmental coordination for the planning, formulation and delivery of STI programs.

The desired outcome of PAPR was to reduce process time and enable increased throughput. PAPR enables the Department of National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces (DND/CAF) to spend earlier. If projects can be completed in a shorter time, project spending can be done earlier and inflationary increases in costs are avoided.  Personnel resources can be better aligned to higher priorities.
The PAPR processes was designed to save project process time measured in comparison to the historical average process time of comparable projects.
Formula/calculation: The reduction in Project Staff Days expended on bringing the project from Identification to Close Out compared to the historical average for comparable projects expressed as a %.
 The value of time savings may also be expressed in terms of:
a. The savings resulting from the expenditure of capital sooner thereby avoiding the impact of inflation;
b. The reduction in Central Staff person days expended on project coordination;

The initial baselines will be established based on current data or on PSPC standards. This will allow DND to improve the management of the performance of contracting and increased contracting authorities. (Ref: SSE Initiative 95)
Formula/calculation: The Performance Measurement Framework will include multiple Performance Indicators that will be indexed to create a single indicator that will identify if the procurement overall met the performance targets.
 # of Projects & Services Contracts that were awarded within the established performance targets / # of Projects & Services Contracts awarded (Expressed in %)
The single indicator will be a function of the following Indicators:
1. Procurement Cycle Time: Contract processing time from requisition to contract award, including the Security Requirements Checklist Process. (Target: 95 days by the end of FY 18/19, 90 days by 31 March 2020)
2. Contracting Irregularities: % of contracting irregularities (Target: <1%) & % of compliance report with no major observation (Target: >95%)
3. Fair, Open and Transparent Procurement: % of complaints from bidders judged in favor of the bidder (Target: <25%), % of goods procurements that are run competitively (Target: >60% for procurements valued above $25k), % of services procurements that are run competitively (Target: >75% for procurements valued above $75k)
4. Client Satisfaction: DND/CAF operational requirements are effectively supported (Target: > 80% client satisfaction)
Measurement Strategy: To be determined
Baseline: To be determined
Notes/definitions: The single indicator is currently in development but will be used for reporting purposes at the end of FY 19.

Mid to long term solution:
1. In order to produce a comprehensive methodology, a working group with RCN, CA, RCAF, CMP (CFB Borden) and VCDS (CFSU Ottawa) will need to be convened to ultimately agree on common service standards.  Sub-working group(s) within each base custodian would also have to be convened in order to agree on service level standards with its base commanders.  For the CA, a representative from the CA G1, G3, G4, DLCI, DLE and Comptroller would work with the CDSGs to agree on standards in their specific areas.
2. In order to standardize services across bases, the methodology would be developed by reviewing amongst others:
a. The type of services provided by each base.
b. Type of units each base is supporting.
c. SLAs currently in place with local municipalities to receive services from or provide services to (fire, ambulance, water, sewage).
d. Current services contracts in place from industry.
3. The plan is to have an initial methodology by June 2018, which could be refined over the next 3 fiscal years.
With a view to strengthening this indicator and methodology by linking the Base Commanders Assessment to the % of availability provided in support of 4 service areas, based on service level agreements, standing orders and other applicable regulations/orders. 
Assessment to the following four service areas:
1. Base Operations and Emergency Services 
2. Base Information Technology Services
3. Base Logistics Services
4. Base Administration Services

Formula/calculation:  
(# of service areas that scored a 5 or 6 / total # of service areas) x 100 
 
Measurement strategy:  
The assessment is based on Base Commanders’ survey responses regarding their level of satisfaction on the quality, timeliness and quantity of base sustainment activities. The results for each activity or service area will be aggregated to produce a comprehensive view across all bases. The areas assessed are scored using a 6 point scale where: 
1 = Very unsatisfied 
2 = Unsatisfied 
3 = Somewhat Unsatisfied 
4 = Somewhat Satisfied 
5 = Satisfied 
6 = Very Satisfied 
 
This assessment is further complemented by survey comments regarding identified challenges and risks linked to each service. 
 
The Fiscal Year 2019-20 survey will evolve from an initial survey administered in Fiscal Year 18-19 so as to ensure consistency in approach across bases.

As one of the largest government landowners, National Defence continuously maintains and upgrades military infrastructure across Canada. This indicator measures the percentage of these properties that are in useable condition. Real property is a significant corporate resource inclusive of land, buildings, roads and water infrastructure.  Effective management of infrastructure is a critical enabler for Canadian Armed Forces operations, whether it be the bases and installations where the military train, prepare for and execute their important missions or housing for military personnel and their families. A high rate of unusable real property could prompt an investigation to identify contributing factors and actions required to better manage the real property portfolio and may also impact the Department's authority from Treasury Board to acquire, lease, let and dispose of land and buildings in their custody. 
 
Formula/calculation:  
(# Defence Properties rated as “Fair” or better / # of Defence Properties) x 100  
 
Measurement strategy 
National Defence assesses the condition of its assets by using a Facility Condition Index (FCI). The FCI is obtained by determining an asset’s replacement cost, as well as its deferred maintenance requirements. The FCI formula is: deferred maintenance divided by replacement cost. National Defence uses industry best practices and rates the assets as follows:   
•	Good =  FCI 0 to .1 
•	Fair = FCI .1 to .3 
•	Poor = FCI 0.3 to 0.7 
•	Non Economically Viable = FCI greater than 0.7 
Baseline:  
The reference point must be re-evaluated after the implementation of the facility condition assessment (FCA). 
 
Notes/definitions 
Accurate FCI data is available for approximately 3,000 assets. These assets represent approximately 80% of the Department’s total Real Property Replacement Cost (RPRC).",

Land and/or buildings that are no longer required for Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF) operations are declared surplus and disposed of by National Defence.

This indicator measures the percentage of National Defence’s real property assets identified as surplus relative to the total owned infrastructure. Consolidating assets with a similar function accelerates the disposal of under-used buildings that do not meet the Department's needs and contributes to having the right infrastructure, in the right place, for the right purpose at the right time.

Investing a minimum percentage of replacement costs in the repair and maintenance of real property helps ensure the integrity of the assets 
Example: One of the questions involves the “% of vehicles whose odometer readings are updated monthly”. Regularly monitoring odometer readings ensures that vehicle maintenance is appropriately scheduled.
Formula/calculation: This indicator is a composite synthesis of the following questions on materiel and real property assets that are asked as part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise: % of vehicles whose odometer readings are monitored monthly to measure utilization and ensure appropriate maintenance; % of replacement value of crown-owned real property spent on repair, maintenance and recapitalization in line with the Guide on the Management of Real Property, which recommends this investment should be at a minimum of 4% of asset replacement costs; % of assets in poor or critical condition; Does the department or agency have an asset management framework; and Does the department or agency have complete and accurate asset information

This indicator is measured through the Management Accountability Framework exercise. Example: having proper internal controls reduces the risk of fraudulent financial transactions.
Formula/calculation: As part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise, departments and agencies are asked specific questions regarding requirements of  the Policy on Internal Control. The three key control areas include: Entity Level Controls, IT General Controls, Business Processes. Departments are required to conduct an annual risk-based assessment of their internal controls along with an ongoing monitoring program once all key controls have been tested and respective remediation activities completed. This indicator looks to assess the % of departments that have assessed all their key controls. Targets for 2016-17 have been set at 90% of departments assessed to be at ongoing monitoring. TBS is developing Policy guidance to ensure that all departments continue to focus their efforts on the ongoing monitoring of internal controls over finanancial reporting and to ensure that effective controls are in place to facilitate the availability of sound financial information for decision-makers.

Appropriate management controls (asset management framework) and monitoring the state of the asset inventory (complete and accurate asset information) on an ongoing basis, is key to confirming the sound stewardship of government resources. The level of deferred maintenance and consequent rust-out of owned real property assets is directly proportional to the proximity of departmental spending to the target 4% of asset replacement value. Investing a minimum percentage of replacement costs in the repair and maintenance of real property helps ensure the integrity of the assets. Example: One of the questions involves the “% of vehicles whose odometer readings are updated monthly”. Regularly monitoring odometer readings ensures that vehicle maintenance is appropriately scheduled. 
 
Calcul/formule : This indicator is a composite synthesis of the following questions on materiel and real property assets that are asked as part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise: % of vehicles whose odometer readings are monitored monthly to measure utilization and ensure appropriate maintenance; % of replacement value of crown-owned real property spent on repair, maintenance and recapitalization in line with the Guide on the Management of Real Property, which recommends this investment should be at a minimum of 4% of asset replacement costs; % of assets in poor or critical condition; Does the department or agency have an asset management framework; and Does the department or agency have complete and accurate asset information

This indicator is measured through the Management Accountability Framework exercise. Example: having proper internal controls reduces the risk of fraudulent financial transactions. 
 
Calculation/formula : As part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise, departments and agencies are asked specific questions regarding requirements of  the Policy on Internal Control. The three key control areas include: Entity Level Controls, IT General Controls, Business Processes. Departments are required to conduct an annual risk-based assessment of their internal controls along with an ongoing monitoring program once all key controls have been tested and respective remediation activities completed. This indicator looks to assess the % of departments that have assessed all their key controls. Targets for 2016-17 have been set at 90% of departments assessed to be at ongoing monitoring. TBS is developing Policy guidance to ensure that all departments continue to focus their efforts on the ongoing monitoring of internal controls over finanancial reporting and to ensure that effective controls are in place to facilitate the availability of sound financial information for decision-makers.

It can identify unforeseen gaps in service design and delivery, thereby supporting efforts to meet the needs and expectations of individuals and businesses. Client satisfaction levels will be measured to better understand user experience with government service design and delivery, which will inform service management approaches to address any shortcomings in client satisfaction. 
 
Calculation/formula : The data source for this indicator is a survey administered by the Institute for Citizen Centred Service. The methodology is established by the Institute for Citizen Centred Service (ICCS). The Office of the Chief Information Officer representative is a National co-chair and will work closely to align this work.

Measurement strategy: This is a quantitative measure that can be used to reasonably reflect the state of the collective bargaining environment (“good” or “bad” faith). The indicator is not contributing to solving a problem per se, but the occurrence of a founded complaint could be a flag for attention or mitigation measures to be applied. A high percentage of “founded” complaints would indicate that the government is not meeting its expectation with regard to bargaining in good faith.

The number of work plans in place signals a commitment to meaningful relationship building and regulatory alignment between parties. An increase in the number of work plans by an average of two a year by 2020 is planned. Furthermore, ways to increase this number are being examined as arrangements are established under new trade agreements
Formula / calculation:  Numerical indicator. TBS tracks the number of programs that have regulatory cooperation work plans in place.
Measurement strategy: Federal regulatory programs with work plans under the Canada-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council, the Canada-European Union Regulatory Cooperation Forum, and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement Regulatory Reconciliation and Cooperation Table are tracked for this numerical indicator.

This will allow TBS to better understand where regulatory cooperation efforts are strongest and where more effort is needed. This indicator is especially important given the recent move of the Canada-US Regulatory Cooperation Council secretariat from the Privy Council Office to TBS in spring 2016 and the establishment of new regulatory cooperation fora: the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement Regulatory Cooperation Forum and the domestic Canadian Free Trade Agreement Regulatory Reconciliation and Cooperation Table. 
The number of work plans in place signals a commitment to meaningful relationship building and regulatory alignment between parties. An increase in the number of work plans by an average of two a year by 2020 is planned. Furthermore, ways to increase this number are being examined as arrangements are established under new trade agreements 
Formula / calculation:  Numerical indicator. TBS tracks the number of programs that have regulatory cooperation work plans in place. 
Measurement strategy: Federal regulatory programs with work plans under the Canada-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council, the Canada-European Union Regulatory Cooperation Forum, and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement Regulatory Reconciliation and Cooperation Table are tracked for this numerical indicator.

As such, it is important that TBS have a strong understanding of the links between new regulatory proposals, and regulatory cooperation efforts with potential trade implications. 
The percentage of high and medium impact regulatory proposals that promote regulatory cooperation will be a useful indicator in determining the level of commitment and effort by departments and agencies to consider the benefits of aligning with major trading partners and international standards. 
 
Calculation/formula:  Indicator in percentage. It is calculated by taking the number of RIAS that promote regulatory cooperation and dividing it by the total number of RIAS. RIAS that promote regulatory cooperation must include details on which jurisdiction(s) the regulations align with and how. If there is no alignment, an acceptable explanation must be given and the RIAS is excluded from the calculation. 
 
Measurement strategy: The indicator is based on information in the RIAS for high and medium impact regulations.
