The efforts made by the people in charge of the program to attract applicants are aimed at ensuring that the CAF reflects the diversity of the country that it defends (Strong, Secure, Engaged, p. 20) as a result of increased awareness of employment opportunities for members of under represented groups within the CAF, including, but not limited to, women, Aboriginals and visible minorities (Strong, Secure, Engaged, p. 23). Through active external marketing and advertising campaigns, the people in charge of the program intend to position the CAF as an employer of choice and meet the personnel needs established by the Government of Canada (GC).

If projects can be completed in a shorter time, project spending can be done earlier and inflationary increases in costs are avoided.  Personnel resources can be better aligned to higher priorities.
The PAPR processes was designed to save project process time measured in comparison to the historical average process time of comparable projects.
Formula/calculation: The reduction in Project Staff Days expended on bringing the project from Identification to Close Out compared to the historical average for comparable projects expressed as a %.

b. The reduction in Central Staff person days expended on project coordination;

Mid to long term solution:
1. In order to produce a comprehensive methodology, a working group with RCN, CA, RCAF, CMP (CFB Borden) and VCDS (CFSU Ottawa) will need to be convened to ultimately agree on common service standards.  Sub-working group(s) within each base custodian would also have to be convened in order to agree on service level standards with its base commanders.  For the CA, a representative from the CA G1, G3, G4, DLCI, DLE and Comptroller would work with the CDSGs to agree on standards in their specific areas.
2. In order to standardize services across bases, the methodology would be developed by reviewing amongst others:
a. The type of services provided by each base.
b. Type of units each base is supporting.
c. SLAs currently in place with local municipalities to receive services from or provide services to (fire, ambulance, water, sewage).
d. Current services contracts in place from industry.
3. The plan is to have an initial methodology by June 2018, which could be refined over the next 3 fiscal years.
With a view to strengthening this indicator and methodology by linking the Base Commanders Assessment to the % of availability provided in support of 4 service areas, based on service level agreements, standing orders and other applicable regulations/orders. 
Assessment to the following four service areas:
1. Base Operations and Emergency Services 
2. Base Information Technology Services
3. Base Logistics Services
4. Base Administration Services

Formula/calculation: In order to determine a rating, analysts will rate each of the following with equal weight to reach an overall score:
1. Are the framing assumptions disclosed?
2. Are the framing assumptions reasonable?
3. Was a sensitivity analysis completed?
4. Was the sensitivity analysis appropriate?
5. Does it disclose controllable versus uncontrollable financial risks?
Measurement strategy: Treasury Board submissions being reviewed by TBS’s Costing Centre of Expertise will be evaluated by an analyst to determine the appropriate scoring on a scale of 1 to 5.

Example: One of the questions involves the “% of vehicles whose odometer readings are updated monthly”. Regularly monitoring odometer readings ensures that vehicle maintenance is appropriately scheduled.
Formula/calculation: This indicator is a composite synthesis of the following questions on materiel and real property assets that are asked as part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise: % of vehicles whose odometer readings are monitored monthly to measure utilization and ensure appropriate maintenance; % of replacement value of crown-owned real property spent on repair, maintenance and recapitalization in line with the Guide on the Management of Real Property, which recommends this investment should be at a minimum of 4% of asset replacement costs; % of assets in poor or critical condition; Does the department or agency have an asset management framework; and Does the department or agency have complete and accurate asset information

This indicator is measured through the Management Accountability Framework exercise. Example: having proper internal controls reduces the risk of fraudulent financial transactions.
Formula/calculation: As part of the Management Accountability Framework exercise, departments and agencies are asked specific questions regarding requirements of  the Policy on Internal Control. The three key control areas include: Entity Level Controls, IT General Controls, Business Processes. Departments are required to conduct an annual risk-based assessment of their internal controls along with an ongoing monitoring program once all key controls have been tested and respective remediation activities completed. This indicator looks to assess the % of departments that have assessed all their key controls. Targets for 2016-17 have been set at 90% of departments assessed to be at ongoing monitoring. TBS is developing Policy guidance to ensure that all departments continue to focus their efforts on the ongoing monitoring of internal controls over finanancial reporting and to ensure that effective controls are in place to facilitate the availability of sound financial information for decision-makers.

A client satisfaction survey will ask deputy heads of government departments about their satisfaction with the direction and advancement on the IT Strategic Plan. Positive results will confirm that the IT Strategic Plan is being implemented properly. Negative results would signal that additional work needs to be undertaken.
Formula/calculation: Annual client satisfaction survey among Deputy Heads, who will provide feedback on behalf of their department/agency on their satisfaction level with the health of GC IT.

The number of work plans in place signals a commitment to meaningful relationship building and regulatory alignment between parties. An increase in the number of work plans by an average of two a year by 2020 is planned. Furthermore, ways to increase this number are being examined as arrangements are established under new trade agreements
