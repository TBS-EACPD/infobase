The Government also increased thresholds for the Repayment Assistance Plan so that no graduate will have to repay their Canada Student Loan until they earn at least $25,000 per year. This change has already helped about 23,000 Canadians delay their payments. Additional measures available in 2018-19 will: increase CSGs for students with dependent children, helping 13,000 students; increase eligibility thresholds for part-time students, helping 10,000 students; and better support the financial pressures of working adults who want to go back to school.",

To ensure that Canadians always have the first opportunity at available jobs, the Government introduced a number of changes to improve the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP).

Canada is focusing its assistance on closing gaps and barriers faced by women and girls in a number of areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, education, governance, environment and climate adaptation, peace and security, and inclusive economic opportunity. By 2021-22, the Feminist International Assistance Policy commits to directing no less than 50 per cent of Canada's annual bilateral international development assistance under to sub-Saharan African countries and ensuring 95 per cent of bilateral aid enhances gender empowerment.",

In addition, the Government introduced guidelines for supporting human rights defenders—a practical tool for Canada’s diplomatic officials to empower human rights defenders as effective advocates and protect them from the threats they all too often face. Canada also became co-chair, with Chile, of the Equal Rights Coalition, the first global intergovernmental network focused on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. In March 2017, Canada led an 83-country Joint Statement on the Power of Inclusion and Benefits of Diversity at the UN Human Rights Council. The June 2017 launch of Canada's first Feminist International Assistance Policy emphasizes the empowerment of women and girls and positioning Canada as a leader on gender equality in aid programming. This new policy makes inclusive governance one of the key action areas for its international assistance. In September 2017, Canada successfully negotiated reference to inclusion and diversity and the enjoyment of all human rights online, including specific reference to Indigenous peoples, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability in the Community of Democracies’ Washington Declaration.",

As part of the Plan, the Government signed an agreement with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) to deliver an asset management program to support municipalities in making informed infrastructure investment decisions. The Government partnered with Statistics Canada and other stakeholders to launch an ambitious data initiative on Canadian infrastructure – Canada’s Core Public Infrastructure Survey (CCPI). Through the survey, the Government will better track, collect, use and share data on Canadian infrastructure, including tracking comparable data on infrastructure usage and demand across jurisdictions; tracking the impacts of infrastructure investments; and tracking the state and performance of public infrastructure across asset classes. These measures will help governments maximize taxpayer dollars and report back to Canadians on outcomes achieved.",
