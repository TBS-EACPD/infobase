Over 1,000 public transit projects have been approved to date under the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund that will expand transit systems across the country and transform the way Canadians live, move, and work by spending less time in traffic. Larger projects to improve access to public transit include: the Regional Express Rail project in the Greater Toronto Area, which will make commuting by GO faster than commuting by car, save 1.8 billion hours of commuter travel time and $14.7 billion in automobile operating savings over the lifetime of the project; and the Réseau électrique metropolitain project in Montreal that will create 34,000 direct and indirect jobs in its construction and reduce close to 35,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases in its first year of operation.",

For the 2016 tax year, the Government has increased community partnerships by 18 per cent, and filed nearly 770,000 Canadians returns on behalf of Canadians so they can get the benefits they are entitled to. The CRA undertook a new initiative in 2016-2017 to proactively contact 260,000 Canadians who were potentially eligible for tax benefits but were not receiving them. The Government has also proactively promoted the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) in Indigenous communities to make sure Indigenous families have full access to this important benefit. By the end of January 2018, in-person visits will have been completed to more than 600 First Nations communities in order to promote the CCB and other benefits. The Government will continue to work to improve these results across all CRA administered benefit programs.",

It is a vital contribution to our partnership with our most important ally, the United States, and for the protection of the continent that we share. It is also important for enabling Canada to fulfill its international commitments as an engaged and active member of NATO. Following consultation with governments and industry, the Government announced in November 2016 that it will launch an open and transparent competition, to replace the legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft with 88 advanced fighters. Canada is also actively exploring options to supplement the CF-18 fighter aircraft fleet until the transition to the permanent replacement aircraft is in place and fully operational. As the processes move along, the Government of Canada will provide regular public updates.",

Taking into account the investments made in Budgets 2016 and 2017, the Government has developed a 12-year plan that will invest over $180 billion across Canada in public transit, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, rural and northern communities, and trade and transportation. As part of the Plan, the Government signed an agreement with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) to deliver an asset management program to support municipalities in making informed infrastructure investment decisions. The Government partnered with Statistics Canada and other stakeholders to launch an ambitious data initiative on Canadian infrastructure – Canada’s Core Public Infrastructure Survey (CCPI). Through the survey, the Government will better track, collect, use and share data on Canadian infrastructure, including tracking comparable data on infrastructure usage and demand across jurisdictions; tracking the impacts of infrastructure investments; and tracking the state and performance of public infrastructure across asset classes. These measures will help governments maximize taxpayer dollars and report back to Canadians on outcomes achieved. <a href=\"http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/about-invest-apropos-eng.html\">More Information</a></p><p class=\"minister-text\">Mandate letters that include this commitment:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-infrastructure-and-communities-mandate-letter\">Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</a></li><li><a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-transport-mandate-letter\">Minister of Transport</a></li></ul></details>",
