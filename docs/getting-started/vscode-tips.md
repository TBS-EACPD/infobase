What's happening?

- `Planned`, case and whole word is matched.
- Of all the matched occurrences, it's replaced with `Spontaneous`
- `files to include`: regex to match filename. In this case, any filename with `.yaml` extension is matched.

# Useful Extensions

- ESLint (Mandatory)
- Prettier (Mandatory)
- GitLens

# Shortcuts

`Cmd+shift+p` (open command palette)

- All commands on VSCode can be done here
- If ESLint is bugging, hit "Reload window" or `Cmd+R`

`Cmd+P`(Search and open by file name)

## Not too important but good to know shortcuts

`Ctrl+tab` (think of alt+tab but within VSCode)

`Cmd+W` (Close current tab)

`Cmd+shift+T` (Re-open closed tabs)

`Cmd+shift+\` (Jump to matching brackets)

`Cmd+D` (Select next match)

`Cmd+,` (open Settings)
