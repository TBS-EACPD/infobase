# TODO Prettier doesn't know our yaml contains markdown, I think some of it's auto formatting might strip meaningful
# whitespace (e.g. double space at end of line to indicate new paragraph). TODO try formatting again, carefully check changes

# TODO This should just be the index.hbs.html, more readable and editable with formatting but less optimized output.
# Maybe add minification of the index html to build base, then let prettier format this file (minification of those files
# might be a bit of headache in dev, might warrant separate dev and prod build base commands)
