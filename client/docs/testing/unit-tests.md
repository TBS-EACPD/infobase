TODO:

- leaning towards mock everything, as simply as possible, and most likely repeat it every time
  - will have to write a lot of tests before I decide what if anything _does_ deserve to be a shared/smarter mock
- hopefully https://github.com/egm0121/jest-test-gen can be a big help with getting that boilerplate going at least
