    E.g.
    - Expenditure update cycle (monthly? quarterly?)
    - How this differs from other estimate/expenditure data in the InfoBase (contains bud and non-bud, expenditures are not final till after close of year)
    - Adjustments? Should explain that they're happening, since expenditures are non-final. Might see the cummulative spending go DOWN after a data refresh 
    - What sort of other COVID spending might not be included here (not sure if there is any? something to confirm with FIN)
