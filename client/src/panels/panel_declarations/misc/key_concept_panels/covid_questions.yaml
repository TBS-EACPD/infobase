    Funding amounts refer to the expected 2020-21 cash value of each measure. These cash values are based in the 
    [Fall Economic Statement 2020 (FES)](https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/home-accueil-en.html), which includes the annual accrual value of each measure. 
    GC InfoBase presents these values on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis to align with the cash-based expenditure values and the spending authorities presented in the Estimates.  

    Cases where the cash value here is higher than the accrual value provided in the FES are due to updates that have occurred since the FES.
