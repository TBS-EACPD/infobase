    Since the start of COVID-19 in early 2020, the Government of Canada has put in place a series of
    measures in order help Canadians who may face hardship due to the pandemic.  Many of these
    measures are aimed at helping Canadians and businesses financially and are being rolled-out
    incrementally as the pandemic evolves.  
    
    GC InfoBase is focused on measures that are presented through the Estimates process, which represent
    most of the government’s response to the pandemic. However, certain measures are not presented in
    the Estimates. Meaning, only a portion of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan is represented
    here.  
    
    In **{{COVID_CURRENT_YEAR}}** **(number of orgs)** organizations across the Government of Canada have spent funds
    in support of the **(number of measures)** measures presented in the Estimates  
    
    To date, the Government of Canada has spent **(spending to date, we don't have this yet though)** in support of Estimates measures with
    the aim of keeping Canadians and businesses healthy, safe, and financially stable.  
    
    To help navigate the complexities of the Canada’s response to the pandemic, the first panel below
    displays **{{COVID_CURRENT_YEAR}}** expenditures by COVID-19, by measure and by organization, as of **{{COVID_LAST_REFRESHED_MONTH}}**. The
    lower panel gives the levels to which spending has been authorized by the government through the
    Estimates process, also displayed both by organization and measure.  
    
    More detailed information can be found in the “Some things to keep in mind as you explore the data…”
    section pinned to the top of the page as you browse. Also, further information can be found in the 2020-
    21 Supplementary Estimates and in the Fall Economic Statement 2020. **TODO, add links to this sentence**
