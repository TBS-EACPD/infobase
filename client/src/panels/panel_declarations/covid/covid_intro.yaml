    Since the start of COVID-19 in early 2020, the Government of Canada has put in place a series of
    measures in order help Canadians who may face hardship due to the pandemic. Many of these
    measures are aimed at helping Canadians and businesses financially and are being rolled-out
    incrementally as the pandemic evolves.  
    
    GC InfoBase reporting is based on measures that are presented through the {{gl_tt "Estimates process" "EST_PROC"}}. The majority of
    the government's COVID-19 measures are presented in the Estimates, but there are some exceptions. As a result a portion of Canada’s 
    COVID-19 Economic Response Plan is not captured here.  
    
    In **{{fmt_year_to_fiscal_year COVID_CURRENT_YEAR}}**, as of **{{COVID_LAST_REFRESHED_MONTH}}**, **(number of orgs)** organizations
    across the Government of Canada have spent funds in support of the **(number of measures)** measures presented in the Estimates.
