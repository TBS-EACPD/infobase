    Since the start of COVID-19 in early 2020, the Government of Canada has put in place a series of measures in order to help Canadians who may face hardship due to the pandemic.
    These measures form {{ext_link "Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan" "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html"}},
    with further details available in the {{ext_link "Fall Economic Statement 2020" "https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/report-rapport/toc-tdm-en.html"}} report.
    A large subset of these measures, notably for direct health and economic supports, are also reported in the
    {{ext_link "Estimates" "https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/planned-government-spending/supplementary-estimates/supplementary-estimates-c-2020-21/covid-19-planned-expenditures.html"}}.
     
    GC InfoBase reporting is currently limited to measures that are presented through the {{gl_tt "Estimates process" "EST_PROC"}}.
    As a result, a portion of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan is not captured here.
