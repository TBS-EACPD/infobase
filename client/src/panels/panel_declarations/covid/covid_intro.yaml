    Since March 2020, the Government of Canada has put in place temporary measures to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadians, businesses and organizations.
    These measures form {{ext_link "Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan (ERP)" "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html"}},
    with further details available in the {{ext_link "Fall Economic Statement 2020" "https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/report-rapport/toc-tdm-en.html"}}.
    Additional information, notably for direct health and economic supports, are also presented in the {{ext_link "Estimates" "https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/planned-government-spending/supplementary-estimates/supplementary-estimates-c-2020-21/covid-19-planned-expenditures.html"}}.  

    GC InfoBase seeks to provide additional information on amounts presented in the {{gl_tt "Estimates" "EST_PROC"}}. For COVID-19, it reports total Estimates authorities,
    but on a measure basis as per the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan (ERP), including associated expenditures where available. Given its focus on the Estimates,
    GC InfoBase does not currently cover the whole of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.
