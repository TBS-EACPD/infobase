    organizations (departments, agencies, and Crown corporations). Updates are ongoing and will be reflected on GC InfoBase monthly. Finalized values
    for the current fiscal year will be available next fiscal year.

    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada plus expenditure data presented
    following the tabling of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the following exceptions have been made for this
    COVID-19 Response section of GC InfoBase:
    * It may include expenditure data that has not yet been published elsewhere, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view
    * Although expenditures from the Employment Insurance Operating Account are not included in Volume II of the Public Accounts, and therefore are not
    included elsewhere on GC InfoBase, these amounts have been included here as they are an important factor in the government's response to COVID-19

    Funding refers to the cash value of a COVID-19 measure in the identified fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board Secretariat.
    These cash values are based in the [Fall Economic Statement 2020 (FES)](https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/home-accueil-en.html), which includes the annual accrual
    value of each measure. GC InfoBase presents these values on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis to align with cash-based expenditure values and the cash-based spending
    authorities presented in the Estimates.  

    Cases where the cash value here is higher than the accrual value provided in the FES are due to updates that have occurred since the publication of the FES.
