    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic,
    the following exceptions have been made for this COVID-19 section of GC InfoBase:
      * It includes expenditure data that has not yet been published in the Public Accounts of Canada, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view.
      * Both {{gl_tt "budgetary" "BUD_EXP"}} and {{gl_tt "non-budgetary" "NB_EXP"}} expenditures and authorities are included here, whereas other GC InfoBase reporting is limited 
    to budgetary amounts only. Non-budgetary expenditures and authorities must be included here for completeness and accuracy as repayable assistance is a critical element of the
    government's COVID-19 response.
      * Although expenditures from the Employment Insurance Operating Account are not included in Volume II of the Public Accounts, and therefore are not
    included elsewhere on GC InfoBase, these amounts have been included here as they are an important factor in the government's response to COVID-19.

covid_questions_funding_value_a:
  transform: [markdown]
  en: |
    Funding refers to the cash value of a COVID-19 measure in the identified fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board Secretariat.
    These cash values are based in the {{ext_link "Fall Economic Statement 2020 (FES)" "https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/home-accueil-en.html"}}, which includes the annual accrual
    value of each measure. GC InfoBase presents these values on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis to align with cash-based expenditure values and the cash-based spending
    authorities presented in the Estimates.  

    Cases where the cash value here is higher than the accrual value provided in the FES are due to updates that have occurred since the publication of the FES.  

    Expenditures may be higher than funding for a given measure due to transfers between organizations and/or the use of existing resources by one or more organizations to support a measure.
    There may also be measures without funding amounts, which represent measures that have been identified in the Estimates that were not included in the FES.

    As of March 2021, GC InfoBase reports Estimates authorities on a measure basis as
    per Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the Fall Economic Statement 2020.
    For the first time, GC InfoBase is reporting on expenditures incurred against authorities as of
    January 31, 2021, where available.

    The current presentation of “Spending Authorities by COVID-19 Measure” better aligns
    authority information with Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the 2020 Fall
    Economic Statement, which provides a thematic list of anticipated authorities at an aggregate
    level. The previous presentation by “Estimates Initiatives” included actual authorities at the
    granular level by department and by initiative.

    GC InfoBase reports on the total authorities included in the Estimates. Excluded from the Estimates are:
      - Measures legislated through the Income Tax Act such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Child Benefit;
      - Employment Insurance Benefits that are paid out of the Employment InsuranceOperating Account; and
      - Liquidity measures such as the Canada Emergency Business Account, and the Business Credit Availability Program.  
    
    Another notable difference between Government announcements in the COVID-19 Economic
    Response Plan and authorities included in the Estimates is the basis of accounting. The
    Estimates use a cash-basis of accounting, reflecting when cash payments are anticipated, while
    Government announcements are based on an accrual-basis of accounting, recognizing cash
    investments over their useful life (e.g. recognizing the cost of an asset over 10 years vs. the year
    in which the cash must be paid).

    GC InfoBase currently only reports on COVID-19 measures which have been presented
    in the Estimates. While this includes some benefits such as the Canada Emergency Response
    Benefit (CERB), not all benefits fall inside the scope of the Estimates, notably:
      - Employment Insurance (EI);
      - Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS); and
      - Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS).

     available. COVID-19 expenditures will be refreshed monthly commencing in April 2021.

    Audited Government expenditures are reported after a fiscal year is complete (in the
    fall), in the Public Accounts of Canada. During the year, the Department of Finance provides
    monthly updates in the Fiscal Monitor; and departments provide information in their Quarterly
    Financial Reports (QFR).
