    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada plus expenditure data presented
    following the tabling of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the following exceptions have been made for this
    COVID-19 Response section of GC InfoBase:
    * It includes expenditure data that not yet be published elsewhere, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view
    * Although expenditures from the Employment Insurance Operating Account are not included in Volume II of the Public Accounts, and therefore are not
    included elsewhere on GC InfoBase, these amounts have been included here as they are an important factor in the government's response to COVID-19

    Funding amounts refer to the expected 2020-21 cash value of each measure. These cash values are based in the 
    [Fall Economic Statement 2020 (FES)](https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/home-accueil-en.html), which includes the annual accrual value of each measure. 
    GC InfoBase presents these values on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis to align with the cash-based expenditure values and the spending authorities presented in the Estimates.  

    Cases where the cash value here is higher than the accrual value provided in the FES are due to updates that have occurred since the FES.
