    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada plus expenditure data presented
    following the tabling of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the following exceptions have been made for this
    COVID-19 section of GC InfoBase:
    * It may include expenditure data that has not yet been published elsewhere, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view
    * Both {{gl_tt "budgetary" "BUD_EXP"}} and {{gl_tt "non-budgetary" "NB_EXP"}} expenditures and authorities are included here, whereas other GC InfoBase reporting is limited 
    to budgetary amounts only. Non-budgetary expenditures and authorities must be included here for completeness and accuracy as repayable assistance is a critical element of the
    government's COVID-19 response.
    * Although expenditures from the Employment Insurance Operating Account are not included in Volume II of the Public Accounts, and therefore are not
    included elsewhere on GC InfoBase, these amounts have been included here as they are an important factor in the government's response to COVID-19

    GC InfoBase currently only reports on COVID-19 measures which have been presented in the Estimates. While this includes some benefits such as the
    Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), not all benefits fall inside the scope of the Estimates.

    Notable COVID-19 related benefits not reported on here include:
      - Employment Insurance (EI)
      - Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS)
      - Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS)

    More information related to benefits and services provided by the Government of Canada to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the global COVID-19
    outbreak can be found on the {{ext_link "COVID-19 benefits and services" "https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/covid19-emergency-benefits.html"}} portal.

    Details of the Government's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan are presented in chapter 1 & 2 of the Fall Economic Statement (FES) 2020. All measures found in the FES 
    that were also presented in the Estimates have been included herein. In addition, a small number of items included in the Estimates, but not found in the FES, are 
    included here as they are, at least in part, driven by COVID-19.

covid_questions_funding_value_a:
  transform: [markdown]
  en: |
    Funding refers to the cash value of a COVID-19 measure in the identified fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board Secretariat.
    These cash values are based in the {{ext_link "Fall Economic Statement 2020 (FES)" "https://www.budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/home-accueil-en.html"}}, which includes the annual accrual
    value of each measure. GC InfoBase presents these values on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis to align with cash-based expenditure values and the cash-based spending
    authorities presented in the Estimates.  

    Cases where the cash value here is higher than the accrual value provided in the FES are due to updates that have occurred since the publication of the FES.

    Expenditures may be higher than funding for a given measure due to transfers between organizations and/or the use of existing resources by one or more organizations to support a measure.
    There may also be measures without funding amounts, which represent measures that have been identified in the Estimates that were not included in the FES.
