    GC InfoBase currently only reports on COVID-19 measures which have been presented
    in the Estimates. While this includes some benefits such as the Canada Emergency Response
    Benefit (CERB), not all benefits fall inside the scope of the Estimates, notably:
      - Employment Insurance (EI);
      - Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS); and
      - Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS).  
    
    More information related to the {{ext_link "benefits and services provided by the Government of Canada" "https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/covid19-emergency-benefits.html"}}

    COVID_TEXT_TODO this French is out of sync with the English, needs a re-translate

    À l'heure actuelle, InfoBase du GC ne fait état que des mesures au titre de la COVID-19 qui figurent dans les budgets des dépenses. Bien que cela comprenne certains avantages
    tels que la Prestation canadienne d'intervention d'urgence (PCU), la portée des budgets des dépenses ne couvre pas toutes les prestations.  

    Parmi les prestations les plus importantes liées à COVID-19 qui ne sont pas mentionnées ici, on peut mentionner les suivantes :
      * Assurance emploi (AE)
      * Subvention salariale d’urgence du Canada (SSUC)
      * Subvention d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer (SUCL)

covid_questions_other_expenditure_reporting_q:
  en: Where does the Government normally report expenditure information (COVID, non-COVID)?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_other_expenditure_reporting_a:
  transform: [handlebars,markdown]
  en: |
    Typically, reporting on government expenditures is done on a monthly basis through the Department of Finance’s Fiscal Monitor, quarterly by departments and annually
    through the Annual Financial Report and the Public Accounts. Final expenditures for {{fmt_year_to_fiscal_year COVID_CURRENT_YEAR}} will be reported in the Public
    Accounts of Canada {{COVID_NEXT_YEAR}} (expected Fall {{COVID_NEXT_YEAR}}).

covid_questions_spent_q:
  en: What are expenditures? What has to happen for dollars to be considered “spent”?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_spent_a:
  transform: [handlebars,markdown]
  en: |
    Expenditures are recorded when cash payments are made from the consolidated revenue fund (e.g. for goods, services, grants, contributions etc.)
    against authorities provided through statutory legislation or appropriation bills for the Estimates. Expenditures do not reflect financial commitments
    made by implementing organizations (departments and agencies) for which an actual payment has not been issued.  

    The Directive on Payments establishes the norm that suppliers are paid within 30 days, from the time when an invoice is received, and the goods or
    services are accepted. A delayed invoice, or different terms in payment schedule (e.g., as per a contract) can result in spending being recorded
    several months after the initial receipt of the goods or services. For these reasons, there may be legal financial commitments made by implementing
    organizations in relation to the response measures, which are not yet included.

covid_questions_implementation_status_q:
  en: What do expenditures to date mean for the status of implementation of the Government’s COVID response plan?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_implementation_status_a:
  en: |
    The estimated expenditures to date indicate the cash payments that have been made to suppliers for goods and services or to grants and contributions recipients. 
    They do not represent the implementation status or results achieved for a measure. Implementing organizations (departments, agencies, and Crown corporations)
    are best positioned to speak to the implementation status of a measure.

#TODO ugh, the most appropriate year for this text won't always be clear (it should probably stay 2021 for some amount of 2021-22?), should it stay hardcoded?
covid_questions_accruals_q:
  en: Will there be COVID-19 accruals at year-end?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_accruals_a:
  en: |
    Like any other program that spans over March 31, 2021, some accruals for COVID-19 programs will be necessary.
    Note that accruals will not be reported with the cash based estimated expenditures presented now or at year-end.

covid_questions_auth_but_no_exp_q:
  en: Why do some organizations and measures have spending authorities but no expenditures?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_auth_but_no_exp_a:
  transform: [handlebars,markdown]
  en: |
    While many spending authorities were authorized earlier in the fiscal year, either through statutory legislation, such as the _Public Health Events 
    of National Concern Payments Act_ or the appropriation act for Supplementary Estimates (B), others were only presented in Supplementary Estimates 
    (C) in February 2021, for which final voted authority is only expected by the end of March. For these measures, organizations may not have had
    recorded payments as of January 31, 2021.  

    In 2020-21, there are 58 organizations and 105 measures with authorities identified as being related to COVID-19 in the Estimates.
    Of these, estimated expenditures are only reported for the 55 organizations and 81 measures that are within the scope of the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan;
    of which 48 organizations have estimated expenditures as of January 31, 2021.

covid_questions_financial_q:
  en: Why does GC InfoBase report COVID-19 financial data under "COVID-19" and not under "Finances"?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_financial_a:
  transform: [handlebars,markdown]
  en: |
    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic,
    the following exceptions have been made for this COVID-19 section of GC InfoBase:
      * It includes expenditure data that has not yet been published in the Public Accounts of Canada, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view.
      * Both {{gl_tt "budgetary" "BUD_EXP"}} and {{gl_tt "non-budgetary" "NB_EXP"}} expenditures and authorities are included here, whereas other GC InfoBase reporting is limited 
    to budgetary amounts only. Non-budgetary expenditures and authorities must be included here for completeness and accuracy as repayable assistance is a critical element of the
    government's COVID-19 response.
      * For certain COVID-19 measures (CERB, CRB), authorities and expenditures may reflect a portion of the costs that are administered through the Employment Insurance Operating Account,
      even though they will not be reported in Volume II of the Public Accounts, or elsewhere on GC InfoBase. 
  fr: |
    Les données financières figurant dans InfoBase du GC proviennent généralement du volume II des Comptes publics du Canada. En raison de la pandémie de COVID-19,
    nous avons fait les exceptions suivantes pour cette section de InfoBase du GC portant sur la COVID-19 :
      * Elle contient entre autres des données sur les dépenses qui n'ont pas encore été publiées dans les Comptes publics du Canada afin de donner une vue d'ensemble à jour de l'administration
      publique fédérale.
      * Les autorisations et dépenses {{gl_tt "budgétaires" "BUD_EXP"}} et {{gl_tt "non budgétaires" "NB_EXP"}} figurent ici tandis que les autres informations contenues dans InfoBase du GC se
      limitent aux seuls montants budgétaires. Par souci d'exhaustivité et d'exactitude, les autorisations et dépenses non budgétaires doivent être incluses ici, car le remboursement de l'aide
      est un élément essentiel de la réponse du gouvernement à la COVID-19.

covid_questions_what_is_new_q:
  en: What is new about the recent data presented on GC InfoBase?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO 
covid_questions_what_is_new_a:
  en: |
    As of March 2021, GC InfoBase reports Estimates authorities on a measure basis as
    per Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the Fall Economic Statement 2020.
    For the first time, GC InfoBase is reporting on expenditures incurred against authorities, where available.

covid_questions_measure_vs_initiative_q:
  en: How does the current presentation of COVID-19 authorities “by measure” differ from the previous presentation of authorities “by Estimates Initiative?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_measure_vs_initiative_a:
  en: |
    The current presentation of “Spending Authorities by COVID-19 Measure” better aligns
    authority information with Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the 2020 Fall
    Economic Statement, which provides a thematic list of anticipated authorities at an aggregate
    level. The previous presentation by “Estimates Initiatives” included actual authorities at the
    granular level by department and by initiative.

covid_questions_authorities_vs_funding_q:
  en: Why don’t authorities correspond to funding announcements made by the Government?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_authorities_vs_funding_a:
  transform: [markdown]
  en: |
    GC InfoBase reports on the total authorities included in the Estimates. Excluded from the Estimates are:
      - Measures legislated through the Income Tax Act such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Child Benefit;
      - Employment Insurance Benefits that are paid out of the Employment InsuranceOperating Account; and
      - Liquidity measures such as the Canada Emergency Business Account, and the Business Credit Availability Program.  
    
    Another notable difference between Government announcements in the COVID-19 Economic
    Response Plan and authorities included in the Estimates is the basis of accounting. The
    Estimates use a cash-basis of accounting, reflecting when cash payments are anticipated, while
    Government announcements are based on an accrual-basis of accounting, recognizing cash
    investments over their useful life (e.g. recognizing the cost of an asset over 10 years vs. the year
    in which the cash must be paid).

covid_questions_frequency_q:
  en: How frequently will COVID-19 spending authorities and expenditures be updated on GC InfoBase?
  fr: COVID_TEXT_TODO
covid_questions_frequency_a:
  en: |
    COVID-19 spending authorities will be updated following the tabling of an Estimates
    (e.g. Supplementary Estimates (A), 2020-21) or as other pertinent information becomes
    available. COVID-19 expenditures will be refreshed monthly commencing in April 2021.
