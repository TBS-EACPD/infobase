    The financial data presented on GC InfoBase is typically based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic,
    the following exceptions have been made for this COVID-19 section of GC InfoBase:
      * It includes expenditure data that has not yet been published in the Public Accounts of Canada, to better provide a more up to date Government of Canada wide view.
      * Both {{gl_tt "budgetary" "BUD_EXP"}} and {{gl_tt "non-budgetary" "NB_EXP"}} expenditures and authorities are included here, whereas other GC InfoBase reporting is limited 
    to budgetary amounts only. Non-budgetary expenditures and authorities must be included here for completeness and accuracy as repayable assistance is a critical element of the
    government's COVID-19 response.
      * For certain COVID-19 measures (CERB, CRB), authorities and expenditures may reflect a portion of the costs that are administered through the Employment Insurance Operating Account,
      even though they will not be reported in Volume II of the Public Accounts, or elsewhere on GC InfoBase.

    Les données financières figurant dans InfoBase du GC proviennent généralement du volume II des Comptes publics du Canada. En raison de la pandémie de COVID-19,
    nous avons fait les exceptions suivantes pour cette section de InfoBase du GC portant sur la COVID-19 :
      * Elle contient entre autres des données sur les dépenses qui n'ont pas encore été publiées dans les Comptes publics du Canada afin de donner une vue d'ensemble à jour de l'administration
      publique fédérale.
      * Les autorisations et dépenses {{gl_tt "budgétaires" "BUD_EXP"}} et {{gl_tt "non budgétaires" "NB_EXP"}} figurent ici tandis que les autres informations contenues dans InfoBase du GC se
      limitent aux seuls montants budgétaires. Par souci d'exhaustivité et d'exactitude, les autorisations et dépenses non budgétaires doivent être incluses ici, car le remboursement de l'aide
      est un élément essentiel de la réponse du gouvernement à la COVID-19.

    As of March 2021, GC InfoBase reports Estimates authorities on a measure basis as
    per Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the Fall Economic Statement 2020.
    For the first time, GC InfoBase is reporting on expenditures incurred against authorities, where available.

  en: |
    The current presentation of “Spending Authorities by COVID-19 Measure” better aligns
    authority information with Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan outlined in the 2020 Fall
    Economic Statement, which provides a thematic list of anticipated authorities at an aggregate
    level. The previous presentation by “Estimates Initiatives” included actual authorities at the
    granular level by department and by initiative.

    GC InfoBase reports on the total authorities included in the Estimates. Excluded from the Estimates are:
      - Measures legislated through the Income Tax Act such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Child Benefit;
      - Employment Insurance Benefits that are paid out of the Employment InsuranceOperating Account; and
      - Liquidity measures such as the Canada Emergency Business Account, and the Business Credit Availability Program.  
    
    Another notable difference between Government announcements in the COVID-19 Economic
    Response Plan and authorities included in the Estimates is the basis of accounting. The
    Estimates use a cash-basis of accounting, reflecting when cash payments are anticipated, while
    Government announcements are based on an accrual-basis of accounting, recognizing cash
    investments over their useful life (e.g. recognizing the cost of an asset over 10 years vs. the year
    in which the cash must be paid).

    GC InfoBase currently only reports on COVID-19 measures which have been presented
    in the Estimates. While this includes some benefits such as the Canada Emergency Response
    Benefit (CERB), not all benefits fall inside the scope of the Estimates, notably:
      - Employment Insurance (EI);
      - Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS); and
      - Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS).

    À l'heure actuelle, InfoBase du GC ne fait état que des mesures au titre de la COVID-19 qui figurent dans les budgets des dépenses. Bien que cela comprenne certains avantages
    tels que la Prestation canadienne d'intervention d'urgence (PCU), la portée des budgets des dépenses ne couvre pas toutes les prestations.  

    Parmi les prestations les plus importantes liées à COVID-19 qui ne sont pas mentionnées ici, on peut mentionner les suivantes :
      * Assurance emploi (AE)
      * Subvention salariale d’urgence du Canada (SSUC)
      * Subvention d’urgence du Canada pour le loyer (SUCL)

    Audited Government expenditures are reported after a fiscal year is complete (in the
    fall), in the Public Accounts of Canada. During the year, the Department of Finance provides
    monthly updates in the Fiscal Monitor and departments provide information in their Quarterly
    Financial Reports (QFR).
