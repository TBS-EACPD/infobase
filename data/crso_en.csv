"RCMP-AYO00","RCMP","Criminal activity affecting Canadians is reduced","Under the authority of the RCMP Act, this Program provides Canadians with policing services at the federal, provincial and municipal levels and within Aboriginal communities. As described in the RCMP Act, these services include all duties that are assigned to peace officers in relation to: the preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime and of offences against the laws of Canada and the laws in force in any province in which they may be employed, and the apprehension of criminals and offenders and others who may be lawfully taken into custody; the execution of all warrants, and performing all duties and services in relation thereto, that may, under the RCMP Act or the laws of Canada or the laws in force in any province, be lawfully executed and performed by peace officers; and, performing other duties and functions as are prescribed by the Governor in Council or the Commissioner. This Program contributes to a safe and secure Canada by providing general law enforcement activities, as well as education and awareness activities delivered by employees of the RCMP to the public, businesses and other agencies/organizations within Canada. The RCMP’s education and awareness activities, such as information sessions on crime prevention, national security, financial crime, and drugs and organized crime, are aimed at reducing victimization of Canadians. This Program also ensures the protection of designated persons and security at major events, which in turn mitigates any potential threats to Canada’s population. Finally, the Program delivers a high level of technical and operational support to the Canadian law enforcement community. Taken together, these activities ensure the RCMP reaches its overarching goal of reducing criminal activity affecting Canadians.",1,1,0

"RCMP-HGD00","RCMP","Canada's police provide international collaboration and assistance while maintaining a rich police heritage nationally","Under authority of the RCMP Act, this Program furthers Canada’s global peace and security agenda by cooperating with and supporting the international law enforcement community, thereby ensuring that both Canadians and the global community are safer. This Program addresses the transnational scope of crime by building relationships with international policing partners and by participating in the INTERPOL global information sharing network. Additionally, the RCMP actively participates in multiple missions abroad in a peacekeeping role and provides support to nations at risk to build their law enforcement capacity.",1,1,0
"RCMP-HGE00","RCMP","Canada's police provide international collaboration and assistance while maintaining a rich police heritage nationally","In order to protect the RCMP’s internationally recognized image, reputation and rich heritage, this Program works to promote the positive image of the RCMP while building relationships with domestic and international law enforcement, government and community partners. The Program provides advice and analysis to internal and external clients, including federal, provincial and municipal partners, academic institutions, Royal Household representatives, and non-government organizations, regarding appropriate ceremonial features of special events and occurrences (e.g., Olympics, expos, summits, police officer funerals).Through the activities of this Program, the RCMP contributes to Canada’s vibrant culture and heritage.",1,1,0
