Where a complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of the RCMP’s response to a complaint, a request can be made to the CRCC for an independent review of the members’ conduct and the RCMP’s handling of the matter. In reviewing complaints, the CRCC may find that it is satisfied with the RCMP’s handling of the complaint or it may make findings and recommendations to the RCMP Commissioner and the Minister of Public Safety with respect to matters addressed in the complaint. The CRCC also conducts reviews of specified RCMP activities, reports to provinces which contract RCMP services, conducts research, program outreach and public education, and provides independent observers to investigations of serious incidents involving RCMP members.",1,1,0

"RCMP-AYO00","RCMP","Police Operations","Under the authority of the RCMP Act, this Program provides Canadians with policing services at the federal, provincial and municipal levels and within Aboriginal communities. As described in the RCMP Act, these services include all duties that are assigned to peace officers in relation to: the preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime and of offences against the laws of Canada and the laws in force in any province in which they may be employed, and the apprehension of criminals and offenders and others who may be lawfully taken into custody; the execution of all warrants, and performing all duties and services in relation thereto, that may, under the RCMP Act or the laws of Canada or the laws in force in any province, be lawfully executed and performed by peace officers; and, performing other duties and functions as are prescribed by the Governor in Council or the Commissioner. This Program contributes to a safe and secure Canada by providing general law enforcement activities, as well as education and awareness activities delivered by employees of the RCMP to the public, businesses and other agencies/organizations within Canada. The RCMP’s education and awareness activities, such as information sessions on crime prevention, national security, financial crime, and drugs and organized crime, are aimed at reducing victimization of Canadians. This Program also ensures the protection of designated persons and security at major events, which in turn mitigates any potential threats to Canada’s population. Finally, the Program delivers a high level of technical and operational support to the Canadian law enforcement community. Taken together, these activities ensure the RCMP reaches its overarching goal of reducing criminal activity affecting Canadians.",1,1,0
