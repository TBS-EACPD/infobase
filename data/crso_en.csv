Record suspensions or pardons can be revoked or cease to have effect for a number of reasons.

Persons convicted of an offence listed in the schedule to the Expungement Act may apply, as well as authorized representatives in cases where the person is deceased. The main difference between a record suspension and an expungement is that with a record suspension, the criminal record is held ‘separate and apart’ from other criminal records, while an expungement will destroy the record.
