1,,2021 Census of Population and Census of Agriculture,adv,Renewing-and-Modernizing-Statistics-Canada,"Statistics Canada has a mandate to conduct the Census of Population and Census of  Agriculture every five years, both of which produce objective, high-quality statistical information that is vital to all levels of government, the private sector, academia and not-for-profit entities. Statistics Canada will conduct the next census in 2021, building on the successes of the 2016 Census of Population, which had the highest response in history to the long form component and set a world record for Internet response. The Government proposes to provide $767.3 million over 10 years, starting in 2018–19, to Statistics Canada to conduct the 2021 Census of Population. The Government also proposes to provide $49.4 million over six years, starting in 2018–19, to Statistics Canada to conduct the 2021 Census of Agriculture.   "
2,,A Community-Based Approach to Dementia,adv,A-Community-Based-Approach-to-Dementia,"More than 400,000 Canadian seniors live with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Women are disproportionately affected, making up two-thirds of this population. Many women also take on the caregiving responsibilities for family members living with dementia. Budget 2018 proposes to provide $20 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $4 million per year ongoing, to the Public Health Agency of Canada to support community-based projects that address the challenges of dementia. Projects could include programs that provide mental health supports and information about self-care for family caregivers, or initiatives that help Canadians locate resources in their communities quickly, including information about best practices for providing care for people living with dementia. This new funding will help to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia and ensure that caregivers—who are predominantly women—have access to the resources they need, including mental health supports.

3,,A National Conversation on Gender Equality With Young Canadians,grw,A-National-Conversation-on-Gender-Equality-With-Young-Canadians,"Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) is a tool used to assess how diverse groups of women, men and gender-diverse people may experience policies, programs and initiatives. The “plus” in the gender-based analysis is an acknowledgment that we need to go beyond sex and gender differences as we have multiple identity factors that intersect and inform who we are, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age and mental or physical ability. Facilitating a national dialogue on the importance of integrating GBA+ in the development of public policies, programs and initiatives is expected to strengthen analytical capacity across the country and provide a means of sharing results and best practices. To this end, the Government proposes to provide Status of Women Canada with $1.3  million in 2018–19 to host a national roundtable on GBA+. The Government also proposes to provide Status of Women Canada with additional funding of up to $7.2 million over five years to lead a national conversation on gender equality with young Canadians.   "
4,,A New Intellectual Property Strategy,prg,A-New-Intellectual-Property-Strategy,"For Canadian businesses to grow and create good, well-paying jobs, they need the ability to turn their new ideas into new goods and services that can compete in the marketplace. To give businesses the confidence they need to grow and take risks, a well-defined strategy that manages and protects intellectual property is needed.

Budget 2018 proposes measures in support of a new Intellectual Property Strategy to help Canadian entrepreneurs better understand and protect intellectual property, and get better access to shared intellectual property.

5,,A New Partnership between Library and Archives Canada and the Ottawa Public Library,adv,A-New-Partnership-Between-Library-and-Archives-Canada-and-the-Ottawa-Public-Library,"The Government also proposes to provide $73.3 million over six years, on a cash basis, starting in 2018–19, with $4.0 million per year ongoing, to support the construction and ongoing operations of a new joint facility that will house Library and Archives Canada and the Ottawa Public Library. This represents the Government’s share of the project, with the balance expected to be provided by the City of Ottawa. This new building will be an iconic community hub, a single door to the national library and archives, and a world-class public library in Canada's capital city which will increase citizen participation in the community and improve access to Canada's history, culture and collective knowledge. It is expected that the new building will be completed by 2023."
6,,A New Process for Federal Election Leaders’ Debates,adv,A-New-Process-for-Federal-Election-Leaders-Debates,"Leaders’ debates play an essential role in Canada’s federal elections by engaging Canadians in the election campaigns and helping to inform their voting decisions. Over the past 50 years, the way leaders’ debates have been negotiated have put at risk the structure and potential usefulness of leaders’ debates. 

The Government proposes to provide $6 million over two years, to be repeated every pre-election and election year, to support a new process that would ensure that federal leaders’ debates are organized in the public interest and improve Canadians’ knowledge of the parties, their leaders and their policy positions. In the coming months, the Minister of Democratic Institutions will bring forward  potential approaches to leaders’ debates. The Government may introduce legislation to implement the approach taken to establish the new process for leaders’ debates.
"
7,,A New Women Entrepreneurship Strategy,prg,A-New-Women-Entrepreneurship-Strategy,"In Canada, fewer than one in six businesses (16 per cent) are majority-owned by women, and businesses owned by women tend to be smaller than businesses owned by men, although the difference varies by industry, according to the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) based on 2014 data from Statistics Canada.

Women entrepreneurs face unique barriers in accessing capital, supply chains and export programs compared to their male counterparts. Women entrepreneurs may also have a harder time receiving training and finding mentorship.

The Government believes that with greater support, women-led businesses could enter, compete and win on the world stage, boosting economic growth and creating more good, well-paying jobs here at home.

This is why helping women entrepreneurs scale up their businesses is a key part of the Government’s Innovation and Skills Plan. Drawing on recommendations made by the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders, the new Women Entrepreneurship Strategy will take a comprehensive approach, addressing critical growth stages and other challenges to better support women entrepreneurs, to help them grow their businesses and to remove barriers to their success.

8,,A Strong Sanctions Regime,adv,A-Strong-Sanctions-Regime,"Sanctions are an important foreign policy tool for Canada: they serve as a way to respond to rapidly developing international crises, violations of international peace and security, and, with the new Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law), to gross violations of human rights or acts of significant corruption. The Government proposes to provide $22.2 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $4.3 million per year thereafter, to Global Affairs Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency to strengthen Canada’s sanctions system, including funds for the development of sanctions policy, coordination with international partners, and providing guidance to Canadians on sanctions obligations.

9,,Adapting Canada's Weather and Water Services to Climate Change,adv,Adapting-Canadas-Weather-and-Water-Services-to-Climate-Change,"Climate change is already having an impact on Canadians. Extreme weather events, such as flooding and wildfires, can have a devastating impact on our people, our communities and our economy.  The Government maintains Canada-wide networks to collect data and monitor changes in weather, climate, water, ice and air. These networks enable the weather, water and environmental predictions that help keep people safe. The Government is proposing through Budget 2018 the following activities and investments to improve weather and water services, through Environment and Climate Change Canada:  Complete the modernization of Canada’s weather forecast and severe weather warning systems, and maintain direct support to the emergency management organizations that prepare for and respond to severe weather ($40.6 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $0.2 million in remaining amortization).  Revitalize water stations, improve services for long-range water forecasts, test and implement new technologies and expand technical and engineering capacity ($69.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $7.3 million in remaining amortization).  Support the operation of water stations that are cost-shared with provinces and territories ($9.8 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with remaining amortization of $3.1 million).

11,,Additional Support for the Feminist International Assistance Policy Agenda,adv,Additional-Support-for-the-Feminist-International-Assistance-Policy,"Taking more innovative approaches to international assistance will also be an essential part of Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy. In addition to the new international assistance resources announced in Budget 2018, the Government proposes to provide $1.5 billion over five years, starting in 2018–19, on a cash basis ($553 million on an accrual basis), and $492.7 million per year thereafter, from existing unallocated International Assistance Envelope resources, to support innovation in Canada’s international assistance through the following two new programs:
•The International Assistance Innovation Program. This program will give the Government greater flexibility for financing arrangements and partnerships and ensure Canada remains at the leading edge of development financing. The Government proposes to commit $873.4 million over five years on a cash basis, and $290.5 million per year thereafter, for this new program.
•The Sovereign Loans Program. This pilot program will diversify the tools Canada has to engage partner countries and international development organizations. It will also better align Canada’s international assistance toolkit with that of other donors. The Government proposes to commit up to $626.6 million over five years on a cash basis, and up to $202.2 million per year thereafter, for the Sovereign Loans Program.

These measures will complement existing core international assistance activities, and will increase the impact of Canada’s international assistance by allowing the Government to explore new and innovative ways to engage internationally, including exploring the use of guarantees, equity and conditionally repayable contributions. These new measures are expected to double Canada’s international assistance provided through innovative tools over the next five years. The Government proposes to introduce any necessary legislative measures to enable Global Affairs Canada to carry out these new programs.

12,,"Addressing ""Unfounded"" Cases of Sexual Assault and Better Supporting Victims",adv,Taking-Action-to-Prevent-and-Address-Gender-Based-Violence-Harassment-and-Discrimination,"Sexual assault is a serious crime that can have devastating and long-lasting effects on victims. When individuals come forward to police, they should be treated with the compassion and respect that they deserve. Positive experiences with police investigations can also encourage others to report these crimes. Following media reports regarding concerns related to the manner in which sexual assault complaints were being investigated by the RCMP and other police forces across Canada, the RCMP undertook a comprehensive review in 2017 of all files where sexual assault complaints were coded as “unfounded.” As a result of this work, looking at more than 2,000 case files so far, 284 additional investigations have been launched as of December 2017. To continue and expand this work, Budget 2018 proposes to provide the RCMP with an additional $10 million over five years, and $2 million per year ongoing, to establish a national unit that will coordinate the review of nearly 25,000 more case files since 2015, as well as provide accountability across the force for investigations, and oversee the development of a curriculum and training to address the problems raised by “unfounded”. An external advisory committee and better supports for victims will also form part of this initiative. The Government as a whole will continue to work with provinces and territories on possible additional actions to help address these issues."
13,,Addressing Demand for Immigration and Refugee Legal Aid,adv,Combatting-Gender-Based-Violence-and-Harassment,"The Government supports provinces that deliver legal aid services to asylum seekers in need of representation during the immigration process. Often, asylum seekers have fled their countries because of a fear of persecution and an inability to return home. Budget 2017 provided funding to enhance immigration and refugee legal aid, in partnership with provinces. Through Budget 2018, this Government proposes to build on these investments and provide an additional $12.8 million for legal aid services to asylum seekers in 2018–19. This investment will help ensure that eligible asylum seekers continue to have access to legal aid."
14,,Addressing the Opioid Crisis,adv,Addressing-the-Opioid-Crisis,"Canada is in the midst of an opioid crisis. In 2016 alone, more than 2,800 Canadian lives were lost to apparent opioid overdoses. British Columbia has been at the forefront of this crisis, declaring a public health emergency nearly two years ago. However, the impact of the crisis is now being felt in many communities across the country—from inner cities to suburbs as well as in northern and rural communities and in Indigenous communities. The Government is committed to taking action."
15,,Advancing Women Business Leaders,prg,Placing-Evidence-at-the-Centre-of-Program-Evaluation-and-Design,"In order to grow, businesses require skills, access to mentorship and networking opportunities.
•Budget 2018 proposes to provide $105 million over five years to the regional development agencies to support investments in women-led businesses, helping them scale and grow, as well as to support regional innovation ecosystems, including incubators and accelerators, and other third-party programs supporting mentorship, networking and skills development. These areas are consistent with the recommendations of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders, and the Expert Panel on Championing and Mentorship for Women Entrepreneurs, chaired by Arlene Dickinson. Further details on these initiatives will be announced in the coming months.
•The federal government is the single largest procurer of goods and services in Canada. In its recent report, the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders recommended that Canada and the U.S. increase the proportion of procurement from women-led businesses. In the U.S., the federal government has set a target that 5 per cent of all federal contracts be awarded to women-led SMEs. The Government of Canada does not currently have sufficient data to be able to assess this figure for all federal procurement, but we are committed to filling this gap in knowledge and reviewing potential options. 
•Moreover, we also recognize the importance of ensuring that women-owned businesses have equal opportunity to participate in federal procurements. Of those SMEs who participate in federal procurement, 10 per cent are women-owned. The Government intends to introduce measures to increase this participation rate by 50 per cent (to at least 15 per cent), in order to reflect the current proportion of SMEs majority led by women entrepreneurs in the broader population.
•The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) will coordinate a series of boot camps across Canada for promising women entrepreneurs looking to start their business. These bootcamps will focus on enhancing business skills and financial literacy. As well, the BDC will expand its suite of online learning content to better equip women entrepreneurs with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed. 
•Growing, women-owned firms will also need to find export opportunities. Budget 2018 proposes that the Government will invest $10 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to connect women with expanded export services and opportunities through the Business Women in International Trade Program, with a specific focus of taking advantage of new opportunities arising from the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.
"
16,,Better Services for Veterans,adv,Better-Services-for-Veterans,"Since 2016, the Government has put in place substantial improvements to the benefits and services available for veterans. For example, the Government has raised financial supports for veterans and caregivers, introduced new education and training benefits and expanded a range of services available to the families of medically released veterans. 

With additional benefits and services now becoming available, more and more veterans are coming forward to get the help they need. For example, over the past two years, Veterans Affairs Canada has seen a 32 per cent increase in the number of applications for disability benefits. To keep up with the rise in demand and ensure that veterans get services and benefits when they need them, the Government proposes to provide $42.8 million over two years, starting in 2018–19, to increase service delivery capacity at Veterans Affairs Canada. 
"
17,,Building More Rental Housing for Canadian Families,grw,Building-More-Rental-Housing-for-Canadian-Families,"Finding a safe and affordable place to call home is a challenge for a growing number of Canadians. Many of our cities lack affordable rental housing, and growing populations and the rising cost of home ownership make it more challenging to find—and afford—a good place to live. The high demand for housing in many communities drives up rental rates and makes it more difficult for Canadians to live and work in the same community.

Approximately 30 per cent of Canadians rely on the rental market for housing. While patterns will vary across cities, future demand for affordable rental housing is expected to rise as the population ages, young professionals migrate to larger cities, and immigration continues to grow our communities. Canadians who wish to buy a home now need a longer period of time to save for a down payment, especially in Canada’s biggest cities.
Unfortunately, high demand for rental housing has not translated into an increase in supply. Vacancy rates remain low in large urban centres such as Toronto and Vancouver—at 1.0 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively.

To encourage a stable supply of affordable rental housing across the country, the Government proposes to increase the amount of loans provided by the Rental Construction Financing Initiative from $2.5 billion to $3.75 billion over the next three years. This new funding is intended to support projects that address the needs of modest- and middle-income households struggling in expensive housing markets. In total, this measure alone is expected to spur the construction of more than 14,000 new rental units across Canada. The Government proposes to provide $113.6  million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to expand the Rental Construction Financing Initiative.
"
18,,Canada Research Chairs,prg,Canada-Research-Chairs,"To attract and retain leading early-career researchers at post-secondary institutions across the country, Budget 2018 proposes a new investment of $210 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $50 million per year ongoing, for the Canada Research Chairs Program. The purpose of this investment will be to better support early-career researchers, while increasing diversity among nominated researchers, including increasing the number of women who are nominated for Canada Research Chairs. This funding will provide the flexibility to improve the program to meet researcher priorities, and could result in, for example, 250 additional Chairs for early-career researchers by 2020–21, and a sizeable increase in funding provided to early-career researchers. The Government expects the granting councils to target new funding to early-career researchers whose diversity better represents Canada’s population.

Over the next year, the Government will be doing further work to determine how to better support students, the next generation of researchers, through scholarships and fellowships.

19,,Canada Summer Jobs 2019-20,grw,Canada-Summer-Jobs-2019–20,"A summer job helps students pay for their education, and gives them the work experience they need to find and keep a full-time job after they graduate. Starting in Budget 2016, the Government supported an additional 35,000 summer jobs under the Youth Employment Strategy’s Canada Summer Jobs program. The Government proposes to provide an additional $448.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to the Youth Employment Strategy. This funding will support the continued doubling of the number of job placements funded under the Canada Summer Jobs program in 2019-20 and provide additional resources for a modernized Youth Employment Strategy in the following years, building on the input of the Expert Panel on Youth Employment. A renewed Youth Employment Strategy will be announced over the course of the next year. "

21,,Canadian Technology Accelerators Program,prg,The-Creation-of-Four-Flagship-Platforms,"To help Canadian firms unlock growth opportunities through exports, the TCS will undergo transformative enhancements to simplify the client experience, modernize tools and offer innovative services.

Exports are vital to the growth of our companies and economy. They help to turn small companies into big ones and support one in every six Canadian jobs, with these jobs typically paying higher wages than others. As stated in Budget 2017, the Government has set a goal to push Canada ahead by growing our country’s exports 30 per cent by 2025. 
One ingredient for success is Canada’s suite of new free trade agreements—important tools for opening up new markets for our businesses. But there is a lot involved for companies trying to capitalize on these opportunities—learning how to do business in these markets, gathering market intelligence, navigating local laws and regulations, and making the right connections.

The Government has a number of programs to help, including Global Affairs Canada’s Canadian Trade Commissioner Service. With over 1,300 trade commissioners in 161 offices around the world and across Canada, the TCS provides companies with advice, connections and funding to help them explore new markets. Other federal partners like Export Development Canada and the Canadian Commercial Corporation offer complementary services, including financing, advisory services, and assistance accessing global supply chains. 

To augment and modernize this platform of export support programs, the Government will be making transformative enhancements in the coming year, with a focus on simplifying the client experience, providing targeted support to high-potential firms and offering innovative services. 

To this end, TCS transformative enhancements will support:
•Amalgamation of multiple trade promotion programs across the Government including CanExport, Canadian Technology Accelerators, Going Global Innovation and Canadian International Innovation Program, under TCS for simpler client navigation.
•The creation of a high-impact, agile TCS workforce with strong expertise. 
•Modernization of digital tools to better serve Canadian businesses, including seamless client navigation across federal partners.
•Orientation towards the new economy, with targeted support towards growing Canada’s exports in technology, digital services and intellectual property.
•Enhancement of local TCS presence across Canada to connect aspiring exporters with the TCS’ platform.
•Efforts to connect women entrepreneurs with export opportunities. 

In addition, Budget 2018 proposes to provide $10 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $2 million per year thereafter, to renew the successful Canadian Technology Accelerators program, which helps high-growth Canadian technology businesses take their leading products and services to key markets in the United States.

Over the next year, the Government will continue to refine its export support platform, including by simplifying and improving the client experience across the TCS, Export Development Canada and other federal partners. 
"
22,,Cannabis Public Education,adv,Cannabis-Public-Education,"The experience of other jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis has underlined the importance of ensuring that Canadians are well informed about cannabis. The Government proposes to provide $62.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, for public education initiatives. This funding will support the involvement of community-based organizations and Indigenous organizations that are educating their communities on the risks associated with cannabis use. The Government also proposes to provide $10 million over five years for the Mental Health Commission of Canada to help assess the impact of cannabis use on the mental health of Canadians, and $10 million over five years to the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction to support research on cannabis use in Canada. These two investments will help inform future policy development, building on earlier significant public education investments of $46 million that have helped inform Canadians. With these investments, Canada’s spending on public education related to cannabis will be on par with the per-capita amounts spent by the State of Washington in its own experience with the legalization and strict regulation of cannabis. "
23,,Cemetery and Grave Maintenance,adv,Cemetery-and-Grave-Maintenance,"Veterans Affairs Canada is committed to honouring the sacrifice of our veterans by maintaining the graves and grave markers for Canadians who were buried or had grave markers erected by the Government of Canada. These sites and markers recognize the bravery and commitment of those who served our country and they must be maintained. There are about 110,000 Canadians buried overseas as a result of the two World Wars, as well as 200,000 graves in Canada for veterans who were low income or whose death was related to their military service.   

In 2017, an evaluation by Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) found that there was a backlog of 45,000 graves cared for by VAC in Canada requiring repairs. With existing levels of funding, the evaluation found that it would take more than 17 years to complete the needed repairs. To eliminate the current backlog of repairs in the next 5 years, the Government proposes to provide funding $24.4 million over five years, starting in 2018–19. The funding will be used for cleaning, restoring or replacing headstones, and fixing foundation issues.

26,,Clean and Safe Drinking Water On Reserve,rec,Clean-and-Safe-Drinking-Water-on-Reserve,"The Government is firm on its commitment: all long-term drinking water advisories on public water systems on reserve will be lifted by March 2021.

Budget 2016 proposed a significant investment of $1.8 billion over five years to support water and wastewater infrastructure in First Nations communities. With the help of these investments, 349 water-related projects in 275 communities have been supported so far. The work done in partnership between First Nations and the Government is delivering tangible results for communities. As of February 12, 2018, 52 long-term drinking water advisories on public water systems have been lifted. For example:
•The Pic Mobert First Nation in Ontario worked with Indigenous Services Canada to build a new water treatment plant that allowed the community to lift a long-term drinking water advisory affecting 295 residents. 
•The Kahkewistahaw First Nation in Saskatchewan completed upgrades and repairs to its water treatment plant, allowing it to provide clean drinking water to its residents for the first time in more than two years.

Budget 2018 builds on prior investments and reaffirms the Government’s commitment by proposing to provide an additional $172.6 million over three years, beginning in 2018–19, to improve access to clean and safe drinking water on reserve. 

This funding will support initiatives to accelerate the pace of construction and renovation of affected water systems, which will result in 25 additional projects being completed by 2020 rather than 2021. 

New investments will also support repairs to high-risk water systems to prevent additional long-term drinking water advisories. In addition, these new investments will assist efforts to recruit, train and retain water operators, and establish innovative First Nations-led service delivery models.

27,,College and Community Innovation Program,prg,Leveraging-the-Full-Potential-of-Business-Academia-Collaboration,"Colleges and polytechnics partner directly with local employers to provide access to skilled students and faculty and specialized equipment to solve pressing business challenges through the College and Community Innovation Program. This program allows small and medium-sized enterprises the ability to undertake applied research to develop novel products for the market or to improve production processes that give businesses the edge to compete—all without having to develop in-house research and development capacity. In maintaining close linkages with their local communities, colleges build awareness among businesses of new and best practices and technologies to support local and economic development.

Colleges are also home to 30 Technology Access Centres (TACs) located across the country—innovation intermediaries that provide access to research facilities and connect the expertise of students and faculty with clients and partners looking to solve innovation challenges. In 2015–16, almost 2,000 companies were served by TACs, over 75 per cent of which were small and medium sized enterprises, and close to 1,000 students were involved in TAC-delivered services—representing almost 89,000 hours of innovation-related skills acquisition.

28,,Combatting Aggressive International Tax Avoidance,grw,Cracking-Down-on-Tax-Evasion-and-Combatting-Tax-Avoidance,"Tax evasion and tax avoidance has a serious financial cost for the Government and all taxpayers. By cracking down on tax evasion, particularly abroad, our Government can ensure that it has the money needed to deliver programs that help the middle class and people working hard to join it. And by preserving the integrity of the tax system, Canada remains positioned as an attractive place to work, invest and do business.

In recent years, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has implemented transformational changes to its compliance programs. By targeting non-compliance in the highest-risk areas, including wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the CRA is able to more effectively limit tax evasion and avoidance.   

These efforts are showing concrete results for Canadians. 

Over the last two fiscal years, the Government reviewed all large money transfers between Canada and eight countries of concern—a total of 187,000 transactions worth a total of over $177 billion that merited closer scrutiny.

Working closely with partners in Canada and around the world, there are now over 1,000 offshore audits, and more than 40 criminal investigations with links to offshore transactions.

The Government is also aggressively going after those who promote tax avoidance schemes, and so far has imposed $44 million in penalties on these third parties.

Thanks to these and all other audit efforts, the Government has identified  $25 billion in fiscal impact from the past two fiscal years. 

To further combat tax evasion and tax avoidance, the Government will invest $90.6 million over five years to address additional cases that have been identified through enhanced risk assessment systems, both domestically and internationally. 

As the CRA has a proven track record of meeting expectations from targeted compliance interventions, Budget 2018 accounts for the expected revenue impact of $354  million over five years. These amounts do not reflect the gain that will be realized by provinces and territories, whose tax revenues will also increase as a result of these initiatives. 

To ensure taxpayers understand and meet their tax obligations, the CRA proposes to continue to expand its outreach efforts. These efforts improve tax compliance through a “get it right from the start” approach that educates, informs and supports taxpayers by improving service and encouraging voluntary compliance.

To ensure that Canada’s federal courts, including the Tax Court of Canada, receive adequate support to address a growing and increasingly complex caseload, the Government will provide $41.9 million over five years, and $9.3 million per year ongoing, to the Courts Administration Service. This investment includes support for new front-line registry and judicial staff, most of whom are expected to support the Tax Court of Canada.

These efforts improve tax compliance through a “get it right from the start” approach that educates, informs and supports taxpayers by improving service and encouraging voluntary compliance.

To ensure that Canada’s federal courts, including the Tax Court of Canada, receive adequate support to address a growing and increasingly complex caseload, the Government will provide $41.9 million over five years, and $9.3 million per year ongoing, to the Courts Administration Service. This investment includes support for new front-line registry and judicial staff, most of whom are expected to support the Tax Court of Canada.

36,,Engaging Men and Boys to Promote Gender Equality,grw,Engaging-Men-and-Boys-to-Promote-Gender-Equality,"Gender equality is not just about women and girls. That is why the Government of Canada will introduce a strategy focused on men and boys. The Government will provide $1.8 million over two years to Status of Women Canada to develop an engagement strategy for men and boys that promotes equality and pilots innovative, targeted approaches to addressing inequality. Few governments have a strategy focused on men and boys as part of their work to create a more egalitarian society; investing in this effort would make Canada a world leader in this area. 

Men and boys have a vital role in creating workplaces that are free of discrimination and in helping to build a society where harassment and gender-based violence are no longer tolerated. They must be part of the solution. At the same time, men and boys also have gendered intersecting identities and experience inequality, and are not all a homogenous group. This work will recognize that gender is not synonymous with women.

39,,Ensuring a Workplace Free of Violence and Harassment,adv,Taking-Action-to-Prevent-and-Address-Gender-Based-Violence-Harassment-and-Discrimination,"Harassment and violence prevents Canadians—particularly women, young people, LGBTQ2 persons, Indigenous Peoples and visible minorities—from participating to the fullest of their potential. Harassment and violence at work stands in the way of growth and success by contributing to productivity loss, turnover, stress and anxiety, and lower job satisfaction. 

On November 7, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-65 to create a single, integrated framework that will protect federally regulated employees from harassment and violence in the workplace. The Government will provide $34.9 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $7.4 million per year ongoing, to support Bill C-65. This will ensure that federally regulated workplaces are free from harassment and violence.

The Government also proposes to establish a Centre of Diversity, Inclusion and Wellness within the public service that will have, as part of its mandate, to better support public servants in dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace within the public service.
"
40,,Ensuring Rules-Based and Responsible Trade,grw,Ensuring-Rules-Based-and-Responsible-Trade,"As we seek to open up markets around the world, we also need to support domestic industries in the wake of trade actions, and need to take steps to ensure a robust rules-based trading system that balances the interests of Canadian stakeholders at home and abroad.

To that end, the Government is committed to supporting and defending the Canadian forest industry in the face of unjustified U.S. duties. The Government proposes to provide $191 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to Global Affairs Canada and Natural Resources Canada to support softwood lumber jobs, including through litigation under the World Trade Organization and the NAFTA dispute settlement mechanisms. The Government will also continue its negotiating efforts towards a durable softwood lumber agreement with the U.S. that will bring stability on both sides of the border.

The Government has also taken steps in recent years, including through amendments to the Special Import Measures Act, to ensure that the trade remedy system is effective and fair. In light of the essential function that the Canadian International Trade Tribunal performs in Canada’s trade remedy system, the Government proposes to amend the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act to ensure that it continues to effectively deliver on its mandate. In addition, the Government recently reviewed the level of anti-dumping duties applied to imports of gypsum board from the U.S., and has concluded that they are preventing injury to domestic producers while ensuring adequate supply in the market. The Government will continue to monitor this situation to ensure the duties are having the intended effect. 

Because it believes that trade is best when it works for everyone, the Government has announced it is creating an independent Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise. This represents a new global standard in promoting responsible business conduct. The Ombudsperson will work to ensure that Canadian firms operating abroad exercise leadership in ethical, social and environmental practices. Funding of $6.8 million over six years, starting in 2017–18, with $1.3 million per year thereafter, will be provided for this initiative.

41,,Ensuring Security and Prosperity in the Digital Age,adv,Ensuring-Security-and-Prosperity-in-the-Digital-Age,"The digital age has revolutionized how Canadians live as well as how our institutions function. Digital technologies have changed the way we work, how we shop, how we access services—including government and financial services. These changes have brought with them vast benefits and new challenges, including efforts to preserve cyber security and protect the privacy of Canadians. Cyber-attacks are becoming more pervasive, increasingly sophisticated and ever more effective. Successful cyber-attacks have the potential to expose the private information of Canadians, cost Canadian businesses millions of dollars, and potentially put Canada’s critical infrastructure networks at risk.   

With this budget, the Government of Canada is implementing a plan for security and prosperity in the digital age to protect against cyber-attacks. The Government proposes significant investments of $507.7 million over five years, and $108.8 million per year thereafter, to fund a new National Cyber Security Strategy. The Strategy focuses on three principal goals: 
•Ensure secure and resilient Canadian systems.
•Build an innovative and adaptive cyber ecosystem.
•Support effective leadership and collaboration between different levels of Canadian government, and partners around the world. 

The Government will work alongside key partners in order to implement this plan: other levels of government, the business community, academia and trusted international partners. Canada will work to proactively solve mutual cyber issues, raising the cyber security bar for all Canadians.

42,,Ensuring That Indigenous Children Are Safe and Supported Within Their Communities,rec,Indigenous-Health-Keeping-Families-Healthy-in-Their-Communities,"For all families and communities, there is no greater priority than ensuring the safety, security and well-being of their children. Indigenous children under the age of 14 make up 7.7 per cent of all children in Canada, but they represent more than half of all children in foster care. This means that Indigenous children have a much higher chance of being separated from their families, communities and cultures. This needs to change. 

The Government is committed to fully implementing the orders of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. To address the funding pressures facing child and family service agencies, while also increasing prevention resources for communities so that children are safe and families can stay together, Budget 2018 proposes to provide more than $1.4 billion in new funding over six years, starting in 2017–18, for First Nations Child and Family Services.  

The Government will continue to work with First Nations, Inuit and the Metis Nation, as well as other partners, to advance the reforms to child and family services that are needed and develop Indigenous-led solutions that put the well-being of children first.

44,,Evidence-Based Policy,grw,Evidence-Based-Policy,"In order to properly address gender inequality and track our progress towards a more equitable society, we need to better understand the barriers different groups face. The Government of Canada intends to address gaps in gathering data and to better use data related to gender and diversity. This includes proposing $6.7 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $0.6 million per year ongoing, for Statistics Canada to create a new Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics. The Centre will maintain a public facing GBA+ data hub to support evidence-based policy development and decision-making—both within the federal government and beyond. 

The Centre will work to address gaps in the availability of disaggregated data on gender, race and other intersecting identities to enrich our understanding of social, economic, financial and environmental issues. The work conducted at the Centre will include collecting, analyzing and disseminating data on visible minorities to understand the barriers different groups face and how best to support them with evidence-based policy.  

As part of the Government’s commitment to address gaps in gender and diversity data, the Government is also proposing to provide $1.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $0.2 million per year ongoing, to the Department of Finance Canada to work with Statistics Canada and Status of Women to develop a broader set of indicators and statistics to measure and track Canada’s progress on achieving shared growth and gender equality objectives. 

Budget 2018 also proposes to provide $5 million per year to Status of Women Canada to undertake research and data collection in support of the Government’s Gender Results Framework. One of the first projects this would support is an analysis of the unique challenges visible minority and newcomer women face in finding employment in science, technology engineering and mathematics occupations. This research will fill important gaps in knowledge as to how to achieve greater diversity and inclusion among the high-paying jobs of tomorrow.

Recognizing the importance of poverty data in evidence-based decision-making by all levels of government, the federal government additionally proposes an investment of $12.1 million over five years, and $1.5  million per year thereafter, to address key gaps in poverty measurement in Canada. This includes ensuring that poverty data is inclusive of all Canadians, data on various dimensions of poverty are captured, and the data is robust and timely.

45,,Expanding the Diversity of Entrepreneurs,prg,Expanding-the-Diversity-of-Entrepreneurs,"Canada's Start-up Visa Program provides permanent resident immigration status to innovative global entrepreneurs with the potential to grow their companies in Canada. In July 2017, the Government announced that the Start-up Visa Program, initially launched as a pilot project, will be made a permanent pathway to immigrate to Canada, as of March 31, 2018.

When first introduced, the Start-up Visa was a small, low-volume program. But in recent years, it has seen increased interest from global entrepreneurs eager to come to Canada and grow their businesses. To match that growing demand, Budget 2018 proposes to provide $4.6 million over five years, beginning in 2018–19, and $0.8 million per year ongoing, to enhance the Start-up Visa client-service experience by ensuring applicants, private sector partners and immigration officials are able to process applications electronically and more efficiently.

46,,Expanding Unified Family Courts,adv,Expanding-Unified-Family-Courts,"Unified Family Courts aim to simplify family justice procedures for Canadians experiencing issues including separation, divorce, support and custody disputes. With access to Unified Family Courts, family law issues are considered under one court system, rather than two, which helps streamline the process and can help reduce the stress and confusion that families may face during this time. In addition, Unified Family Courts use specialized judges who are familiar with the sensitive nature of family law issues and offer a range of programs and support services to families. The combination of these specialized courts and enhanced services for families can help resolve issues more efficiently. 

To enhance access to justice and improve outcomes for a significant number of Canadian families, the Government proposes to provide $77.2 million over four years, starting in 2019–20, and $20.8 million per year ongoing, to support the expansion of Unified Family Courts, creating 39 new judicial positions in Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. This expansion will create a more streamlined process for those who rely on these services. The Government intends to introduce corresponding legislative amendments to create these new judicial positions to enhance Unified Family Courts.

Challenges remain, however, in meeting the complex and varied needs of offenders, including for women inmates in federal corrections, whose numbers have grown by approximately 30 per cent over the last 10 years. Budget 2018 builds on the investments made in Budget 2017, proposing $20.4 million over five years, beginning in 2018–19, and $5.6 million per year ongoing, for the Correctional Service of Canada to further support the mental health needs of federal inmates.

However, newcomers sometimes face significant barriers to finding and keeping good jobs, including language challenges, lack of Canadian experience, a lack of social networks and, in some cases, discrimination. For many visible minority newcomer women, there are additional barriers, including both gender- and race-based discrimination, precarious or low-income employment, lack of affordable and accessible child care, lower language and literacy levels, lack of community and social supports, and limited or interrupted education in their home country. To help reduce these barriers, the Government will launch a three-year pilot to support programming for newcomer women who are also members of visible minorities and provide $31.8 million over three years starting in 2018–19. "
52,,Granting Councils,prg,Granting-Councils,"Canada’s three granting councils are arm’s-length organizations that provide federal funding for the work of researchers at post-secondary institutions and research hospitals. In Budget 2018, the Government is proposing a historic investment to support this work—the most new funding for fundamental research through the granting councils in Canadian history.

The Government proposes to invest $925 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $235 million per year ongoing:
•$354.7 million over five years ($90.1 million per year ongoing) to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). 
•$354.7 million over five years ($90.1 million per year ongoing) to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
•$215.5 million over five years ($54.8 million per year ongoing) to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). 

To accelerate Canada’s transition to a more modern approach to research, Budget 2018 also proposes to create a new tri-council fund to support research that is international, interdisciplinary, fast-breaking and higher-risk. The Government proposes to provide $275 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $65 million per year ongoing, for this innovative approach, which will be administered by SSHRC on behalf of the granting councils.                              
These two proposed investments would increase the granting councils’ annual budgets for fundamental research by over 25 per cent when they reach their peak in three years time. The proposed funding would provide increased support and training opportunities for about 21,000 researchers, students and high-quality personnel across Canada every year by 2021–22, including: 6,000 top-tier researchers and principal investigators; 3,500 early-career researchers; 8,000 undergraduate, master’s and doctoral students; 1,300 postdoctoral students; and 2,000 research assistants and technicians.
With this investment, the granting councils will be tasked with developing new plans, strategies and targets to ensure greater collaboration between NSERC, CIHR and SSHRC and support for interdisciplinary research, as well as plans to achieve greater diversity among research funding recipients, including improved support for women, underrepresented groups and early-career researchers. To support these goals, the Government proposes to provide $6 million over five years ($0.5 million ongoing) for surveys to collect improved data on researchers, and $15 million over five years to implement programs that support improved equality and diversity in academia at post-secondary institutions.

53,,Harnessing Big Data,prg,Harnessing-Big-Data,"Digital research infrastructure is the collection of connectivity, computing power and storage services needed to support data-intensive and computationally-intensive research. Big data has become an essential tool for progress in science, underpinning world-class research across all disciplines. Improved technologies, such as cloud computing and faster networking, allow for new opportunities to address scientific challenges. For example, medical researchers in genomics can use advanced research computing to analyze genetic sequences to look for DNA-related changes that might cause cancer or dementia. Eventually, researchers may be able to develop personal medical treatment plans for patients based on genetics, age and behavioural data, improving health outcomes. Improved access to essential digital research tools and services will strengthen Canada’s reputation as a global leader in science, research and innovation.

The Government proposes to provide $572.5 million over five years, with $52 million per year ongoing, to implement a Digital Research Infrastructure Strategy that will deliver more open and equitable access to advanced computing and big data resources to researchers across Canada. The Minister of Science will work with interested stakeholders, including provinces, territories and universities, to develop the strategy, including how to incorporate the roles currently played by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Compute Canada and CANARIE, to provide for more streamlined access for Canadian researchers.

Indigenous groups are seeking to rebuild their nations in a manner that responds to their priorities and the unique needs of their communities—a message they have shared with the Working Group of Ministers on the Review of Laws and Policies related to Indigenous Peoples. This was also a key recommendation of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and is an objective outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As stated by the Prime Minister at the United Nations General Assembly, the Government supports this vital work.

Through Budget 2018, the Government proposes to provide $101.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to support capacity development for Indigenous Peoples. Funding would be made available to Indigenous groups to support activities that would facilitate their own path to reconstituting their nations.

To maximize the effectiveness of these programs, particularly in the way that they offer support to workers wishing to take advantage of emerging opportunities, the Government will undertake a horizontal review of skills programming over the next year. In support of this review, the Government proposes to provide $0.75 million in 2018–19 to the Treasury Board Secretariat. This, in conjunction with the Future Skills organization, will provide Canada’s labour force with the information and training needed to meet future challenges and opportunities head on.  "
56,,Implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda,adv,Implementing-the-2030-Agenda-for-Sustainable-Development,"Canadians can be proud of our history of helping others around the world, including providing emergency and development assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable. We understand that a safer, more prosperous world means a safer and more prosperous Canada. 

In 2015, Canada, along with all other United Nations member states, committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which set 17 goals (known as Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs) to eliminate poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity by the year 2030. These goals are universal, and apply to all countries. This means working to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, tackle climate change and support sustainable economic growth here at home, and helping other countries through our diplomacy, trade, peace and security, and international assistance efforts. 

To reach these goals, in 2016, the Government of Canada began a comprehensive review of its international assistance support to improve the effectiveness of Canada’s international assistance. The result was a new Feminist International Assistance Policy, unveiled in June 2017, and centred around SDG 5: Gender Equality. 
To support reporting and ensure continued progress and coordination of our efforts on the Sustainable Development Goals both domestically and internationally, the Government proposes to provide $49.4 million over 13 years, starting in 2018–19, to establish a Sustainable Development Goals Unit, and fund monitoring and reporting activities by Statistics Canada. This will enable better coordination among all levels of government, civil society organizations and the private sector on Canada’s efforts on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It will also support the monitoring and reporting of Canada’s domestic and international efforts to ensure that all of the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved by 2030 and that no one is left behind. The Government is also proposing to provide, from existing departmental resources, up to $59.8 million over 13 years, starting in 2018–19, for programming to support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.

58,,Improving Access to the Canada Workers Benefit,grw,Improving-Access-to-the-Canada-Workers-Benefit,"At the same time, the Government recognizes that not all low-income workers are receiving the CWB (previously WITB) payment that they are entitled to. This happens because some lower-income workers do not claim the benefit on their tax return. The Government is proposing amendments that will allow the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to automatically determine whether these tax filers are eligible for the benefit. An estimated 300,000 additional low-income workers will receive the new CWB for the 2019 tax year as a result of these changes. This represents a major step forward in fulfilling the Government’s commitment of making sure that all Canadians receive the tax benefits and credits to which they are entitled. 

CWB enhancements, combined with new investments to make sure that every worker who qualifies actually receives the benefit, will mean that the Government is investing almost $1 billion of new funding for the benefit in 2019, relative to 2018. The Government estimates that enhancements and improved take-up in 2019 will directly benefit more than 2 million working Canadians, many of whom were not benefitting from the WITB. This will help lift approximately 70,000 Canadians out of poverty.

Moving forward, the Government will continue to work with interested provinces and territories to harmonize benefits and help support the transition from social assistance and into work. Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia and Nunavut have already taken advantage of the opportunity to make province- and territory-specific changes to the design of the program. 

In addition, over the next year, the Government will also begin work on improving the delivery of the CWB to provide better support to low-income Canadians throughout the year, rather than through an annual refund after filing their taxes.

There is a need for federal leadership in this area, to support a harmonized national approach and dialogue, leading to strategies to address sexual violence, to create safe campuses, and to remove the stigma from reporting or seeking support following sexual violence. The Government proposes to provide up to $5.5 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to Status of Women Canada to work with stakeholders, including provinces and territories, towards developing a harmonized national framework to ensure consistent, comprehensive and sustainable approaches in addressing gender-based violence at post-secondary institutions across the country. Starting in 2019, for those universities and college campuses that are not implementing best practices addressing sexual assaults on campus, the Government of Canada will consider withdrawing federal funding."

Implementation began in September 2007 and is expected to wind down over the next few years. 

For many survivors of residential schools and their families, the healing process has been long and very difficult. In light of this, the Settlement Agreement committed to providing survivors and their families with mental health and emotional support services to help them as they heal. Through Budget 2018, the Government proposes to provide $248.6 million over three years, starting in 2018–19, for services, including mental health and emotional supports to survivors and their families for the duration of the Indian Residential School Settlement.

64,,Indigenous Health: Keeping Families Healthy in Their Communities,rec,Indigenous-Health-Keeping-Families-Healthy-in-Their-Communities,"There are significant gaps in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Infant mortality rates of First Nations and Inuit children are up to three times higher, diabetes rates are up to four times higher, and suicide rates among First Nations youth are between five and seven times higher. This gap in health outcomes can be narrowed, and providing access to quality health care close to home is an essential part of that change. 

To keep Indigenous families healthy, Budget 2018 proposes to invest $1.5 billion over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $149 million per year ongoing, as follows:
•$498 million, with $97.6 million per year ongoing, to sustain access to critical medical care and services, including 24/7 nursing services in 79 remote and isolated First Nations communities. 
•$200 million, with $40 million per year ongoing, to enhance the delivery of culturally appropriate addictions treatment and prevention services in First Nations communities with high needs. 
•$235 million to work with First Nations partners to transform First Nations health systems by expanding successful models of self-determination so that health programs and services are developed, delivered and controlled by and for First Nations. This investment will also support access to quality and First Nations-controlled health care in remote and isolated James Bay communities as part of the Weeneebayko Area Health Integration Framework Agreement.
•$490 million over two years to preserve access to medically necessary health benefits and services through the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.

65,,Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program,rec,Indigenous-Skills-and-Employment-Training-Program,"Indigenous Peoples are less likely to be employed than non-Indigenous Canadians, and those who do work typically earn less. To help close the employment and earning gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, Budget 2018 proposes to invest $2 billion over five years, and $408.2 million per year ongoing, to support the creation of a new Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program, which will replace the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy. This includes incremental investments of $447 million over five years, and $99.4 million per year ongoing, and a stronger focus on training for higher-quality, better-paying jobs rather than rapid re-employment. This additional funding will assist approximately 15,000 more clients gain greater skills and find jobs that will support their long-term career success.

The Government has consulted with, and heard from, Indigenous partners on the importance of a distinctions-based approach that recognizes the unique needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation. To that end, the new program will provide: 
•$1.1 billion over five years, and $235.7 million per year ongoing, for a First Nations stream. 
•$325 million over five years, and $67 million per year ongoing, for a Métis Nation stream. 
•$161.2 million over five years, and $32.6 million per year ongoing, for an Inuit stream. 
•$213.4 million over five years, and $45.2 million per year ongoing, for an urban/non-affiliated stream.

66,,Indigenous Sport,rec,Indigenous-Sport,"Indigenous youth are far more likely than their non-Indigenous peers to be in care, not to complete high school, to be unemployed and to suffer from poor health. 

Community-led sport can be a powerful tool to support Indigenous youth. It promotes social inclusion, builds self-esteem, strengthens Indigenous identity, instills a sense of pride and reduces the risks of suicide. Indigenous boys are more likely than Indigenous girls to participate in sport, with adolescence being a pivotal time for predicting whether or not girls will participate in sports as they grow older. Girls who play sports at a young age are more likely to be physically active as adults. Through Budget 2018, the Government proposes to invest $47.5 million over five years, and $9.5 million per year ongoing, to expand the use of sport for social development in more than 300 Indigenous communities. This initiative will help to scale up a highly successful model developed by Right To Play that has led nearly 90 per cent of participants to have a more positive attitude toward school and a greater sense of identity. As this initiative is implemented, the Government will look for opportunities to profile excellence among Indigenous youth in sport.

The Canada Media Fund receives financial contributions from the Government and Canada’s cable, satellite and Internet protocol television distributors.

With Canadians increasingly watching content online, contributions from the broadcasting sector to the Canada Media Fund have started to decrease in step with their declining revenues. To address this issue, the Government has committed to increase its contribution in order to maintain the level of funding in the Canada Media Fund.

The Government proposes to provide $172 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $42.5 million per year ongoing, to maintain the level of funding in the Canada Media Fund at the 2016–17 level. While the actual Government contributions will fluctuate depending on the broadcasting sector revenues, this approach will provide a stable source of funding to develop Canadian content and support good jobs, including for our writers, producers, directors, actors and crews.

78,,Modernizing Canada’s Regulatory Framework,prg,Modernizing-Canada-s-Regulatory-Frameworks,"In its December 2017 report, the Advisory Council on Economic Growth identified three priority areas for establishing an agile regulatory system designed for the new economy:
•Catalyze innovation across the economy through regulations that accommodate emerging technologies and business models, especially in high-potential sectors. 
•Drive coordination between agencies and jurisdictions, both within Canada and internationally. 
•Promote efficient and predictable regulation.

These priority areas were further supported by the early reports of the six Economic Strategy Tables.

In response to these recommendations, Budget 2018 proposes to provide $11.5 million over three years, starting in 2018–19, for the Government to pursue a regulatory reform agenda focused on supporting innovation and business investment. The goal is to make the Canadian regulatory system more agile, transparent and responsive, so that businesses across the country can explore and act on new opportunities, resulting in benefits for all Canadians. The approach includes:
•Targeted reviews, over the next three years, of regulatory requirements and practices that are bottlenecks to innovation and growth in Canada, with an initial focus on agri-food and aquaculture, health/bio-sciences, and transportation and infrastructure, including emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles. 
•Canada’s leadership on internal trade at the Canadian Free Trade Agreement Regulatory Reconciliation and Cooperation Table.
•Developing an e-regulation system—an online platform modelled on the successful U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website Regulations.gov—to engage Canadians on regulation in order to improve the transparency and efficiency of the overall rule-making process.

The Government also proposes to introduce legislation to reduce the regulatory burden faced by businesses. This includes streamlining Canada’s Customs Tariff legislation in order to simplify its structure and administration. This measure will reduce the overall complexity of the legislation, which will ease administrative burden and reduce compliance costs for Canadian businesses and government.

81,,More Women and Girls in Sport,adv,More-Women-and-Girls-in-Sport,"Canada’s women and girl athletes do us proud at high-performance sport events, and regularly achieve podium success at Senior World Championships, and Olympic and Paralympic Games. However, fewer Canadian women and girls participate in sport and physical activity than men and boys—Statistics Canada estimates that in 2010 approximately one-third of Canadian men and one-sixth of Canadian women regularly participated in sport. Men are also approximately two to three times more likely to be coaches, officials or in other leadership positions than women.

We need to create an environment where women and girls feel comfortable engaging in physical activity and sport—at all ages and all levels. To do so, we need to better understand why women and girls choose not to participate in sport, or move into the senior ranks of coaching or management of sports, and then work to remove the barriers that exist. 

This is why through Budget 2018, the Government is setting a target to achieve gender equality in sport at every level by 2035, and proposes to provide an initial $30 million over three years to support data and research and innovative practices to promote women and girls’ participation in sport, and provide support to national sports organizations to promote the greater inclusion of women and girls in all facets of sport.

This hotline will help protect those vulnerable to being trafficked and enable victims to access the necessary social and law enforcement services they need. As this initiative proceeds, the Government will work with provinces and territories to ensure effective implementation."
83,,National Research Council,prg,strongStronger-and-More-Collaborative-Federal-Science-strong,"
As the National Research Council re-imagines itself to deliver on the Innovation and Skills Plan, it will be taking targeted action to include more women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and visible minorities among its researchers. Targeted actions include ensuring there are no unintended barriers to the participation of women researchers and entrepreneurs in the National Research Council’s programs, as well as increased outreach to diverse groups of Canadians so they are fully aware of its programs and the opportunity to participate.

Governments around the world leverage their own research assets and talent to help businesses undertake commercially relevant but high-risk research, which can in turn lead to successful global companies. The National Research Council has the facilities, expertise and networks to convene strategic, large-scale national teams committed to cutting-edge innovation. Budget 2018 announces a “re-imagined” National Research Council and proposes to provide $540 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $108 million annually for measures that will reinforce its research strengths and role as a trusted collaboration partner of industry.
•To catalyze transformative, high-risk, high-reward research with the potential for game-changing scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs, the Government proposes to provide $150 million over five years with $30 million per year ongoing, to the National Research Council to fund its scientists to work with innovators from post-secondary institutions and businesses on multi-party research and development programs. This research will be modelled on the highly successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States.
•To encourage, test and validate transformative research ideas generated by the National Research Council’s world-class scientists, the Government proposes to provide $30 million over five years with $6 million per year ongoing, to the National Research Council to establish an ideation fund to target breakthrough research ideas through a competitive peer-reviewed process. 
•To enhance collaboration with businesses and improve access to the National Research Council’s specialized facilities and equipment, scientists and technical services, the Government proposes to provide $62 million over five years with $12.4 million per year ongoing, to lower access fees charged to small and medium-sized enterprises and universities and colleges.
•To allow for better long-term research planning and delivery, the Government will convert the National Research Council's longstanding temporary funding into ongoing permanent funding by providing $298 million over five years and $59.6 million per year ongoing. Total funding proposed under Budget 2018 will raise the National Research Council’s total annual budget to $1.1 billion.

The National Research Council is only one of the Government’s science-based organizations. The Government has recently announced significant new funds in support of activities in other science-based federal departments and agencies.

The Government and the Assembly of First Nations have worked together to articulate a vision for a new fiscal relationship for First Nations communities. To better support First Nations communities, to support strong Indigenous institutions and to advance the new fiscal relationship with First Nations, Budget 2018 proposes to invest $188.6 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, in the following ways:
•$127.4 million over two years to directly support First Nations communities in building internal fiscal and administrative capacity. This includes $87.7 million over two years to ensure that communities under default management are able to move forward on projects that form part of their management action plans, and to support pilot projects in order to strengthen governance and community planning capacity in First Nations.
•$50 million over five years, and $11 million per year ongoing, to strengthen the First Nations Financial Management Board, the First Nations Finance Authority and the First Nations Tax Commission. 
•$2.5 million over three years to support the First Nations Information Governance Centre’s design of a national data governance strategy and coordination of efforts to establish regional data governance centres.
•$8.7 million over two years to continue and broaden work with First Nations leadership, technical experts, researchers and community representatives on the new fiscal relationship. 

The Government, with First Nations partners, will also undertake a comprehensive and collaborative review of current federal government programs and funding that support First Nations governance. The purpose of the review will be to ensure that these programs provide communities with sufficient resources to hire and retain the appropriate financial and administrative staff to support good governance, plan for the future and advance their vision of self-determination.

This funding will support key priorities, including the closing of socio-economic gaps, infrastructure, data collection and governance."
86,,New Tri-Council Fund,prg,Granting-Councils,"Canada’s three granting councils are arm’s-length organizations that provide federal funding for the work of researchers at post-secondary institutions and research hospitals. In Budget 2018, the Government is proposing a historic investment to support this work—the most new funding for fundamental research through the granting councils in Canadian history.

The Government proposes to invest $925 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $235 million per year ongoing:
•$354.7 million over five years ($90.1 million per year ongoing) to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). 
•$354.7 million over five years ($90.1 million per year ongoing) to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
•$215.5 million over five years ($54.8 million per year ongoing) to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). 

To accelerate Canada’s transition to a more modern approach to research, Budget 2018 also proposes to create a new tri-council fund to support research that is international, interdisciplinary, fast-breaking and higher-risk. The Government proposes to provide $275 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $65 million per year ongoing, for this innovative approach, which will be administered by SSHRC on behalf of the granting councils.
These two proposed investments would increase the granting councils’ annual budgets for fundamental research by over 25 per cent when they reach their peak in three years time. The proposed funding would provide increased support and training opportunities for about 21,000 researchers, students and high-quality personnel across Canada every year by 2021–22, including: 6,000 top-tier researchers and principal investigators; 3,500 early-career researchers; 8,000 undergraduate, master’s and doctoral students; 1,300 postdoctoral students; and 2,000 research assistants and technicians.

With this investment, the granting councils will be tasked with developing new plans, strategies and targets to ensure greater collaboration between NSERC, CIHR and SSHRC and support for interdisciplinary research, as well as plans to achieve greater diversity among research funding recipients, including improved support for women, underrepresented groups and early-career researchers. To support these goals, the Government proposes to provide $6 million over five years ($0.5 million ongoing) for surveys to collect improved data on researchers, and $15 million over five years to implement programs that support improved equality and diversity in academia at post-secondary institutions.
"
87,,Pay Transparency,grw,Pay-Transparency,"The Government will provide Canadians with more information on pay practices of employers in the federally regulated sector. This would include converting existing pay information filed by federally regulated employers under the Employment Equity Actinto more user-friendly online content, with specific attention paid to making existing wage gaps more evident. This will help to highlight employers who lead in equitable pay practices, while holding employers accountable for wage gaps that affect women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and visible minorities. Experience in other jurisdictions has shown it to be helpful in raising awareness about the wage gap. The Government will commit $3 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to implement pay transparency. 

Recognizing that barriers to women’s labour market participation can be complex and slow to move, the Government will also host a major symposium on women and the workplace in the spring of 2019. This symposium will bring together leaders in the private and public sectors to discuss and share best practices. The objective of the symposium would be to encourage and provide tools for Canadian employers to address issues faced by women in the workplace, from wage gaps to harassment. The Government will provide $1.5 million over 2018–19 and 2019–20 for this symposium. 

Closing the wage gap between men and women requires action on many fronts. Investing in affordable and accessible child care and family leave, increasing women’s participation in traditionally male-dominated occupations, encouraging men to work in traditionally female-dominated occupations, implementing family-friendly workplace policies and challenging gender stereotypes that reinforce notions of “appropriate” work for men and women are some of these areas. Through Budget 2018, the Government will take targeted action to advance these goals—recognizing the significant work that remains to be done.

In order to keep pace with rapid technological change that can challenge its ability to effectively collect foreign signals intelligence, the Government proposes to provide the Communications Security Establishment $225 million over four years, starting in 2020–21, and $62.1 million ongoing, to ensure this capability is preserved.  "
94,,Pricing Carbon Pollution and Supporting Clean Growth,adv,Pricing-Carbon-Pollution-and-Supporting-Clean-Growth,"Central to Canada’s plan to fight climate change and grow the economy is the understanding that pollution has a real, tangible cost. It puts stress on the health of our communities, our economy and on Canadians themselves. That is why the Government of Canada is committed to putting a price on carbon pollution. 

To ensure that a price on carbon pollution is in place across Canada, the Government is developing a federal carbon pollution pricing system that would apply in provinces and territories upon request, and in provinces and territories that do not have a pricing system in place that meets the federal standard by the end of 2018. The direct revenue from the carbon price on pollution under the federal system will be returned to the province or territory of origin.

Provinces and territories requesting that the federal system apply, in whole or in part, in their jurisdiction should confirm this by March 30, 2018. Provinces and territories establishing or maintaining their own system need to outline how they are implementing pricing on carbon pollution by September 1, 2018. The Government will review each system and implement the federal system in whole or in part on January 1, 2019 in any province or territory that does not have a carbon pollution pricing system that meets the minimum standard. 

The Government recently released draft legislative proposals on the federal carbon pollution pricing system, as well as a regulatory framework outlining the approach to carbon pollution pricing for large industrial facilities, and intends to introduce legislation to establish that system. 

To support the development and implementation of the federal carbon pollution pricing system, the Government will provide $109 million over five years, starting in 2017–18, to the Canada Revenue Agency and Environment and Climate Change Canada to implement, administer and enforce the federal carbon pollution pricing system.

In addition, to ensure that the actions established in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change are transparent and informed by science and evidence, the Government proposes to make available $20 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, through Environment and Climate Change Canada to fulfill the Framework’s commitment to engage external experts to assess the effectiveness of its measures and identify best practices.

97,,Protecting Jobs in Eastern Canada's Forestry Sector,prg,Protecting-Jobs-in-Eastern-Canada-s-Forestry-Sector,"The sustainable management of our natural resources leads to long-term economic opportunity. Research on the spruce budworm, one of the most damaging pests to spruce trees in Canada, has identified ways to protect forests against its cyclical outbreaks. This is critical to support the forest industry and, in turn, jobs in parts of the country—such as Atlantic Canada—where the forestry sector is an important part of the economy.

Through Budget 2018, the Government proposes to take action alongside Atlantic provinces and the forest industry, by making available up to $74.75 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, based on a 60:40 federal to provincial and industry cost-sharing basis, to prevent the spread of spruce budworm. Federal contributions will come from Natural Resources Canada.

Refugee women and girls face increased risks due to their gender, and are at risk of, or have suffered from, sexual violence and exploitation, physical abuse and marginalization.

Since 2015, Canada has demonstrated global leadership in providing protection to the world’s most vulnerable refugees. As of January 2017, more than 40,000 Syrian refugees were welcomed in Canada, where they have built new lives for themselves and their families. In addition, Budget 2017 announced funding of $27.7 million over three years, beginning in 2017–18, to resettle Yazidi women and girls, who were being targeted for abduction and enslavement by Daesh fighters in northern Iraq and Syria.

Building on these efforts, the Government commits to increase the number of vulnerable refugee women and girls to be resettled in Canada as government-assisted refugees. Specifically, Budget 2018 proposes funding of $20.3 million over five years, beginning in 2018–19, to welcome an extra 1,000 refugee women and girls from various conflict zones around the world.

As the single largest purchaser of Canadian goods and services, the Government of Canada has a unique opportunity to support the growth of Canadian businesses. The introduction of Innovative Solutions Canada fulfilled a longstanding request from Canadian companies that need a “first customer” to test and validate their innovations. With this assistance, Canadian businesses that operate in areas of strategic importance to our economy are better able to scale up, create new jobs and find new customers around the world.

To simplify the suite of innovation programs across the federal government, Budget 2018 proposes to consolidate the existing Build in Canada Innovation Program, focused on the procurement of later stage innovative goods and services, into Innovative Solutions Canada.

In addition, Canadian companies have long asked the federal government to improve its relationship with suppliers—to make opportunities easier to find, simpler to navigate and faster to award, with less administrative burden. Government procurement is heavily paper-based and offers limited self-serve options for suppliers.

Moving procurement online is a key element of a more efficient procurement system. It will allow more suppliers to connect with the Government, and make government procurement opportunities more accessible to potential suppliers, regardless of size or geographic location.

To this end, the Government will establish a new electronic procurement platform. This will help Canadian small and medium-sized businesses better access opportunities to work with the Government. Budget 2018 proposes to provide $196.8 million over five years, beginning in 2018–19, to Public Services and Procurement Canada to establish this platform.

The Government also recognizes the importance of ensuring that women-owned businesses have equal opportunity to participate in federal procurement opportunities. In this regard, e-procurement will support the Government’s commitment as part of the new Women Entrepreneurship Strategy to increase the participation rate for women-owned small and medium-sized businesses in the federal procurement supply chain to 15 per cent, and efforts to ensure that diverse suppliers are provided with more opportunities to compete in federal procurement

125,,Stabilizing and Future Transformation of the Federal Government's Pay Administration (Phoenix),adv,Stabilizing-and-Future-Transformation-of-the-Federal-Governments-Pay-Administration-(Phoenix),"Canada’s public servants deserve to be paid properly and on time for their important work. In early 2016, the Phoenix pay system for federal public servants was implemented following years of planning and development as part of a broader initiative originally intended to save money. Since that time, it has been obvious that the outcomes have been unacceptable for both the Government and its employees. The Transformation of Pay Administration Initiative launched in 2009 was under-resourced and suffered from poor planning and implementation. The Government is doing everything it can to make this right. 

To date, the Government has committed more than $460 million to implement the Phoenix pay system and resolve subsequent issues. Over the last year and a half, the Government has hired several hundred people to rebuild capacity that was lost due to the previously flawed business plan. In addition, action has also been taken to reimburse employees who have incurred personal expenses as a result of pay issues. However, serious issues and challenges with the Phoenix pay system continue, and too many federal public servants are not being properly paid.  

Through Budget 2018, the Government is committing to the next steps in addressing the ongoing challenges of the Phoenix pay system, including announcing its intention to eventually move away from Phoenix and begin development of the next generation of the federal government’s pay system, one that is better aligned with the complexity of the federal government pay structure. In this context, the Government proposes to provide an additional investment of $16 million over two years, beginning in 2018–19, to work with experts, federal public sector unions and technology providers on a way forward for a new pay system. 

In the interim, the Government will continue to address the existing pay challenges. To this end, Budget 2018 proposes an investment of $431.4 million over six years, starting in 2017–18, to continue making progress on Phoenix issues, including hiring additional staff to support the pay system, bringing the number of employees working on pay issues at the Pay Centre and satellite offices to more than 1,500. This compares to the 550 employees that were originally intended to handle all pay issues when the new pay system was launched. Furthermore, this additional funding would go towards hiring more staff within departments to better assist employees with payroll issues as they arise. This would mean that public servants also have better access to a broader range of supports in the workplace.   

Budget 2018 also proposes to provide $5.5 million over two years, starting in 2017–18, to the Canada Revenue Agency for the processing of federal government employee individual income tax reassessments that are required due to Phoenix pay issues, and for handling related telephone enquiries. 

While the Phoenix pay system has been underpaying some public servants, it has also been paying others too much. Under current legislation, any employee who receives an overpayment in respect of a previous year is required to pay back the gross amount to their employer and recover excess withholdings from the Canada Revenue Agency. Public servants in this situation can rest assured that they will not have to start repaying until after the Canada Revenue Agency processes their tax return and refunds the excess withholdings (or credits them against a tax liability). At the same time, the Government is reviewing the legislation and will engage key stakeholders to assess the feasibility of changes to the legislation that would permit any private or public sector employee in this situation to repay the amount net of withholdings, starting for the 2018 taxation year and forward. 

Finally, to address the real mental and emotional stress and unacceptable financial impacts on public servants, the Government has initiated discussions with public service representatives to address the numerous grievances and legal actions. Similarly, the Government will also take action to reimburse missing and inaccurate dues that are owing to public sector unions.

This initiative will enable the Government to undertake engagement and outreach with Indigenous Peoples and organizations to better understand their statistical, data governance and information management needs, and to provide technical support services such as statistical training, courses and tools grounded in the needs of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. It will help Indigenous leadership, communities and governments build their own data and research capacities, and provide greater support to Indigenous institutions and organizations. 

In addition, Budget 2018 proposes to provide the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council with $3.8 million in 2018–19 to develop a strategic plan that identifies new ways of doing research with Indigenous communities, including strategies to grow the capacity of Indigenous communities to conduct research and partner with the broader research community.

131,,Strengthening Multiculturalism and Addressing the Challenges Faced by Black Canadians,adv,Strengthening-Multiculturalism-and-Addressing-the-Challenges-Faced-by-Black-Canadians,"Diversity is Canada’s strength and a cornerstone of Canadian identity. Recent domestic and international events, like the rise of ultranationalist movements, and protests against immigration, visible minorities and religious minorities, remind us that standing up for diversity and building communities where everyone feels included are as important today as they ever were. 

To provide support for events and projects that help individuals and communities come together, the Government proposes to provide $23 million over two years, starting in 2018–19, to increase funding for the Multiculturalism Program administered by Canadian Heritage. This funding would support cross-country consultations on a new national anti-racism approach, would bring together experts, community organizations, citizens and interfaith leaders to find new ways to collaborate and combat discrimination, and would dedicate increased funds to address racism and discrimination targeted against Indigenous Peoples and women and girls.

As a first step toward recognizing the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians, the Government also proposes to provide $19 million over five years that will be targeted to enhance local community supports for youth at risk and to develop research in support of more culturally focused mental health programs in the Black Canadian community. In addition, with the creation of the new Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics, announced in Chapter 1, the Government is committed to increase the disaggregation of various data sets by race. This will help governments and service providers better understand the intersectional dimensions of major issues, with a particular focus on the experience of Black Canadians.

Through Budget 2018, the Government proposes to provide $20 million over five years for two new initiatives to better support the needs of Canadians experiencing autism spectrum disorder and their families. This will include the creation an Autism-Intellectual-Developmental Disabilities National Resource and Exchange Network (AIDE) to develop online resources, an inventory of services, employment opportunities and local programming for families across the country, based on their specific needs. The Network would be led by the Pacific Autism Family Network and the Miriam Foundation. Funding of $9.1 million will also be provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada to support community-based projects that will support innovative program models, help reduce stigma, and support the integration of health, social and educational programs to better serve the complex needs of families.

135,,Support for Distinctions-Based Housing Strategies,rec,Support-for-Distinctions-Based-Housing-Strategies,"Safe, adequate and affordable housing gives people a sense of security and helps build strong communities. But for too many Indigenous Peoples, this remains out of reach. Nearly one in five Indigenous people live in housing that is in need of major repairs, and one in five also live in housing that is overcrowded. Access to adequate and affordable housing is a particular challenge for Indigenous women. In 2011, 27 per cent of Indigenous women lived in core housing need compared to 13 per cent of Indigenous men.[1] Lack of adequate housing can compound barriers to security, employment and overall well-being, which tend to disproportionately affect Indigenous women.

Indigenous leaders have told the Government that when it comes to housing in First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation communities, the best approach is one that respects the distinct needs of each Indigenous group. The Government agrees. As announced in Canada’s first-ever National Housing Strategy, the Government and Indigenous partners are working together to improve housing conditions over the long term and to ensure that Indigenous Peoples have greater control over housing in their communities.

Through investments made in Budget 2017 and Budget 2018, the Government proposes dedicated funding to support the successful implementation of each of the distinctions-based housing strategies, including:
•An additional $600 million over three years to support housing on reserve as part of a 10-year First Nations Housing Strategy that is being developed with First Nations.
•$400 million over 10 years to support an Inuit-led housing plan in the Inuit regions of Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and Inuvialuit. This is in addition to the $240 million over 10 years announced in Budget 2017 to support housing in Nunavut, where additional funding was provided for Inuit housing.
•$500 million over 10 years to support the Métis Nation’s housing strategy.

136,,Support for the Correctional Service of Canada and the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada,adv,Safeguarding-the-Integrity-of-Our-Public-Safety-System,"The Correctional Service of Canada is responsible for the federal correctional system and protects public safety by actively encouraging and assisting offender reintegration. It provides correctional programming, opportunities for offender rehabilitation and practical skills development, and strengthening of community corrections. The Government proposes to invest $74.7 million in 2018–19 to enable the Correctional Service of Canada to continue existing operations in support of its mandate. 

As the ombudsman for federally sentenced offenders, the Office of the Correctional Investigator serves Canadians and contributes to safe, lawful and humane corrections through independent oversight of the Correctional Service of Canada. The Office provides accessible, impartial and timely investigations of individual and systemic concerns in federal correctional facilities. To support this work, the Government proposes to provide the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada with $3.4 million over five years beginning in 2018–19, and $0.7 million per year ongoing. These funds will be used to enhance the Office’s investigative capacity, including its ability to delve more deeply into Indigenous corrections and the overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples within the federal correctional system.

137,,Supporting a Healthy Seniors Pilot Project in New Brunswick,adv,Supporting-a-Healthy-Seniors-Pilot-Project-in-New-Brunswick,"Canada’s population is aging—the most recent demographic information from Statistics Canada shows that approximately 17 per cent of the Canadian population are age 65 or older, up from about 15 per cent five years earlier. 

Notably, women make up the majority of the Canadian population over the age of 65. Senior women face different challenges than senior men—women tend to live longer than men, and as such more senior women live alone than their male counterparts. In addition, the responsibility of care for aging spouses and parents predominantly falls on women. 

As Canada’s population continues to age, we need to be prepared for the challenges that seniors, especially senior women, face. That is why Budget 2018 proposes to provide $75 million in 2018–19 through the Public Health Agency of Canada to support the Healthy Seniors Pilot Project in New Brunswick. New Brunswick is uniquely suited to undertake this pilot project as its population is aging faster than the rest of Canada. A higher proportion of New Brunswick’s population is over the age of 65—compared to other provinces—and the province is home to a measurably higher proportion of women over the age of 65, relative to the Canadian average.  

The Healthy Seniors Pilot Project will support a range of research initiatives to examine how governments can better support seniors in their home, communities and care facilities. This project will help us better understand the gendered impacts of an aging population, improve the quality of life for our senior citizens, and help us lay the groundwork for the dissemination of best practices in supporting healthy aging for all Canadians.

138,,Supporting Canada’s Official Languages,adv,Supporting-Canadas-Official-Languages,"Canada’s linguistic duality, which for 50 years has been enshrined in the Official Languages Act, is an integral part of Canada’s history and identity. Strong official language minority communities not only celebrate our shared history and identity, they are essential to Canada’s competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world. The Government understands the challenges that official language minority communities are facing, and has developed an Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023 to help address some of these challenges. In addition to serving existing communities, providing services and initiatives in both official languages is key to improving the integration and settlement of new immigrants. By promoting official bilingualism and empowering our communities to tell their stories, we strengthen Canada’s diversity, strengthen our communities and increase our influence around the world.

The Government proposes to provide $400.0 million in new funding over five years, starting in 2018–19, with $88.4 million per year ongoing, in support of the Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023. Key measures will be implemented by Canadian Heritage, Employment and Social Development Canada, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Statistics Canada, and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and will include funding for: 
•Community organizations to ensure that they are able to continue to provide important services for individuals in their communities, to welcome newcomers, and to foster early childhood development. 
•Cultural, artistic and heritage activities, including community theatre, art workshops, and activities showcasing local heritage or history.
•French- and English-language minority community radio stations and newspapers. 
•Development of an interactive application to make it easy for Canadians to learn English or French as a second language.
•Improved access to services for English-speaking communities of Quebec in their official language.
•The recruitment and retention of teachers who teach French and English as a second language.
•Minority official language schools, $20 million for a variety of early learning and child care initiatives.

Taken together, the Action Plan will help improve services in official language minority communities and promote bilingualism across Canada.

Access to justice is not only about having an efficient and effective court system, it is also about having access to information, services and processes that enable Canadians to better understand and exercise their legal rights.  

The Government recognizes that access to justice is a foundation of Canadian society and will invest in strengthening the Canadian judiciary, supporting Canada’s court system, and enhancing openness and transparency. Together, these measures reinforce the Government's strong commitments to respecting the rule of law and to upholding a justice system that is accessible, fair and efficient.

140,,Supporting Community Women's Organizations,grw,Supporting-Community-Women-s-Organizations,"When women come together, change happens. This is true around the world, and it’s true here in Canada. Across the country, women’s organizations play an important role in raising social awareness and mobilizing communities to change laws, attitudes and social norms.Created in 1973, the Women’s Program provides funding support for women’s organizations and community-based groups working to implement systemic change through projects at the local, regional and national level. These projects strive to advance gender equality by addressing the following priorities: ending violence against women and girls; improving women’s and girls’ economic security and prosperity; and encouraging more women and girls to reach leadership and decision-making positions. 

To support more initiatives that build the capacity of equality-seeking organizations, reduce gender inequality in Canada, and promote a fairer and more productive society, the Government proposes to provide $100 million over five years to Status of Women Canada to enhance the Women’s Program. This investment will increase organizational and sector capacity on a needs basis, allowing organizations to participate in ongoing training, skills development and community engagement, while reducing competition among equality-seeking organizations for funding. This investment will also ensure better funding for organizations focused on vulnerable women, including groups such as Indigenous women, women with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ2 communities, and newcomer and migrant women.

141,,Supporting Equal Parenting and the Flexibility for Earlier Returns to Work,grw,Pay-Transparency,"For most Canadians, starting a family typically comes at the same time that parents-to-be are working to establish or further their careers. To help new parents care for their children during those critical early months, Employment Insurance (EI) maternity and parental benefits are available. These help to provide greater financial security when parents are away from work. 

EI parental benefits are available to both parents, allowing either parent to take time off work. The most common scenario, however, involves the mother taking on the primary caregiving responsibilities once their child is born. While the second parent may take on many household and caregiving responsibilities, child care duties continue to fall disproportionately to mothers, both in the short term following the arrival of their child, and over the longer term, often due to the challenges of re-entering the workforce after time spent away.

Call to Action 79 calls for historical commemoration activities, and recognition and acknowledgement of the contributions that Indigenous Peoples have made to Canada’s history. In response to this call, Budget 2018 proposes to provide $23.9 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to Parks Canada to integrate Indigenous views, history and heritage into the national parks, marine conservation areas and historic sites managed by that agency."
143,,Supporting Local Journalism,adv,Supporting-Local-Journalism,"As more and more people get their news online, and share their interests directly through social media, many communities have been left without local newspapers to tell their stories. 

To ensure trusted, local perspectives as well as accountability in local communities, the Government proposes to provide $50 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, to one or more independent non-governmental organizations that will support local journalism in underserved communities. The organizations will have full responsibility to administer the funds, respecting the independence of the press. 

Further, consistent with the advice laid out in the Public Policy Forum’s report on news in the digital age, over the next year the Government will be exploring new models that enable private giving and philanthropic support for trusted, professional, non-profit journalism and local news. This could include new ways for Canadian newspapers to innovate and be recognized to receive charitable status for not-for-profit provision of journalism, reflecting the public interest that they serve.

Reflecting commitments in the Canada–Métis Nation Accord—which outlines ways in which Canada and the Métis National Council will work together to set priorities and develop policy in areas of shared interest—Budget 2018 proposes to invest $516 million over 10 years, including $500 million over 10 years to support a Métis Nation housing strategy, $10 million in 2018–19 to support Métis Nation post-secondary education, and $6 million over five years to support the Métis Nation in gathering health data and developing a health strategy. Furthermore, as announced elsewhere in this chapter, Budget 2018 also proposes to invest $325 million in the Métis Nation stream of the Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program, which supports employment services, skills development and job training.

These investments in Métis Nation priorities reflect the Government’s commitment to apply a greater distinctions-based lens to Indigenous funding decisions and support the Métis Nation’s vision of self-determination.

ParticipACTION is a national non-profit organization, originally established in 1971, whose mission is to make physical activity a vital part of everyday life. 

The Government proposes to provide $25 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, for ParticipACTION to increase participation in daily physical activity among Canadians.

The scope of policing operations within the RCMP is constantly evolving to address new and emerging threats, including in the areas of cybercrime, serious and organized crime, and national security investigations. The Government proposes to invest $80 million in 2018–19 to reinforce existing RCMP policing operations. This funding also supports the recruitment and training of new RCMP cadets to help meet demands for new frontline federal officers in Canada. 

The Government also proposes to invest $60.2 million over five years, and $9.5 million per year ongoing, for the RCMP to renew radio systems in four divisions: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and the National Capital Region. Two-way radios are a lifeline for frontline police officers. They continue to be the most available, secure and efficient communications tool for policing. Secure radios are also critical for maintaining officer safety, promoting interoperability with other first responders and, ultimately, protecting Canadians.

Developed in collaboration with the Wenjack family, the goal of the Fund is to continue the conversation that began with Chanie Wenjack’s residential school story. In particular, the Fund supports activities to promote reconciliation, build awareness, and educate Canadians about residential schools and the legacy that this experience still has for many Indigenous Peoples today. 

The Fund supports tangible projects that encourage cross-cultural dialogue and awareness among Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities and that create places and spaces dedicated to reconciliation. The Fund also partners with educators and Indigenous communities to develop curricula for Canadian schools that accurately describe Indigenous history.  

To support these reconciliation initiatives across Canada, Budget 2018 proposes to provide $5 million in 2018–19 to support the Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund.

151,,Supporting The Next Generation of Rural Broadband,prg,Developing-the-Next-Generation-of-Rural-Broadband,"The Government recognizes that access to the internet is more than just a convenience—it is an essential means by which citizens and businesses access information, offer services and create opportunities. To reach the most remote areas of Canada, new technological solutions will be required. One promising example is the use of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites.

Networks of LEO satellites have the potential to provide Canadians living in rural and remote areas with significantly improved access to Internet and wireless services at more affordable prices. LEO satellites, situated closer to the surface of the Earth than traditional high orbit satellites, can receive and transmit data with significantly improved response times, speeding up data services, while maintaining the benefits of satellite technology, including the ability to provide Internet across challenging landscapes at much lower costs than fibre-optic technology. Canada is also uniquely placed with space satellite industry leaders to build and operate LEO satellite technologies, creating jobs and market opportunities around the world. Budget 2018 proposes funding of $100 million over five years for the Strategic Innovation Fund, with a particular focus on supporting projects that relate to LEO satellites and next generation rural broadband.
"
152,,Supporting the Recognition of Rights and Self-Determination,rec,Permanent-Bilateral-Mechanisms,"While Canada has advanced a number of modern treaties and agreements since the 1970s, the pace of progress in many cases has been slow and uneven. Negotiations can take a decade or more, and Indigenous communities are forced to take on debt in order to participate. 

Budget 2018 outlines new steps the Government will take to increase the number of modern treaties and self-determination agreements in a manner that reflects a recognition of rights approach. These changes, along with the new approach brought forward through the Recognition of Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination negotiation process, will shorten the time it takes to reach new treaties and agreements, at a lower cost to all parties. 

As part of this new approach, the Government of Canada will be moving away from the use of loans to fund Indigenous participation in the negotiation of modern treaties. Starting in 2018–19, Indigenous participation in modern treaty negotiations will be funded through non-repayable contributions.

The Government will engage with affected Indigenous groups on how best to address past and present negotiation loans, including forgiveness of loans. 

Through Budget 2018, the Government also proposes to invest $51.4 million over the next two years to continue its support for federal and Indigenous participation in the Recognition of Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination discussion tables.

The Government has a vital role to play in helping to create a more equitable society, free from discrimination of any kind. 

Everyone deserves to live a life free from violence. While gender-based violence is often thought of through the lens of violence against women and girls, many Canadians face violence every day simply because of their gender expression, gender identity or perceived gender. 

The negative impacts of gender-based violence reach far beyond any specific population. While gender-based violence significantly influences the health, social and economic conditions of the individuals who directly experience it, it also has long-lasting and negative results for family members, friends and entire communities. 

The Government proposes to provide an additional $86.0 million over five years, starting in 2018–19, and $20.0 million per year ongoing, to expand Canada’s Strategy to Address Gender-Based Violence. New investments will focus on:
•Preventing teen dating violence.
•Enhancing and developing preventative bullying and cyber bullying initiatives.
•Equipping health professionals to provide appropriate care to victims.
•Enhancing support for the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre to increase investigative capacity of the RCMP.
•Expanding the High Needs Victims Fund so that more organizations, such as rape crisis centres, are better able to help population groups who are at the highest risk of experiencing violence. This investment will double the support provided to this initiative in Budget 2017.
•Providing support to sexual assault centres in close proximity to Canadian Forces bases so that members of the Canadian Armed Forces have access to a full spectrum of supports to address gender-based violence. This builds on other investments in family support services through Strong, Secure, Engaged, the Government’s new defence policy.
