Record suspensions can be revoked or cease to have effect if an individual is convicted of a new indictable offence, or in some cases a summary offence, found to no longer be of good conduct,  found to have made a false or misleading statement or hidden information.  Through this core responsibility the PBC screens applications for completeness and the eligibility of each applicant, collects information for decision-making and develops policy to guide decision processes.  This program is also responsible for assessing requests and providing recommendations under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy (i.e. clemency) and providing advice to the Minister on the merits of each case.  Clemency is granted in exceptional circumstances in deserving cases involving federal offences, where no other remedy exists in law to reduce severe negative effects of criminal sanctions.
