In 2016-17, four of six program areas exceeded the target of reducing the non-compliance rate by 2% (Equipment, Operations, OHS and Track).
Signals and Crossings did not meet the target and both saw increases to their non-compliance rates. 
Both industry and Transport Canada inspectors are in transition to the oversight of the new e Grade Crossings Regulations  requirements that came into force late in 2014. While the requirements have a seven-year transition phase-in period to 2021, some came into force immediately, which largely accounts for the non-compliance rate. Given this, we expect that the non-compliance rates may be higher for the first few years of transition. /

This makes it difficult to compare 2014–15 to 2015–16. 

Five funding recipients included in the 2014–2015 calculations for Ontario did not have data available for 2015–2016 at the time of the preparation of the report; four additional funding recipients were included for 2015–2016.

There was a marked decrease in the participation rates in Manitoba — 949 students were tested in 2015–16  compared to 6,336 students in 2014–15. As the data are aggregated, no analysis can be made as to whether the absence of specific student groups has caused a decrease in actual results.
Testing of this nature is no longer performed in Saskatchewan.
Some funding recipients in Alberta no longer test grade three students and others have added grade nine to 12 students. There is one extra recipient included in 2014–2015 calculations in comparison to 2015–2016.i Published data are not available for British Columbia for 2015–2016. For 2014–2015, literacy and numeracy results for all genders were merged. For 2013–2014, results were not broken down by gender, and literacy results were reported by reading and writing.

Headed by the Nutrition North Canada Advisory Board, the Nutrition North Canada 2016 public engagement process was conducted between May and December 2016. Over 20 community visits were held across the country, alongside 63 key stakeholder interviews. This was accompanied by a survey in electronic and hard-copy formats that gathered 268 responses, and a social media campaign. Key engagement findings were summarized in a What We Heard Report, which is being used to inform the co-development of policy options with key stakeholders that will guide future program updates and ensure that Nutrition North is more responsive to Northerners while remaining sustainable.","text","","","At or below the annual trend
