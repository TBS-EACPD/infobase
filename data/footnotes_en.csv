The remaining $8.0 million represents statutory forecasts that do not require additional approval and are provided for information purposes only.


ACOA's approved authorities for 2017–18 of $311.5 million represent an increase of $3.3 million when compared to the 2016–17 Main Estimates of $308.2 million.


This increase in spending of $3.3 million is due to an increase in transfer payments of $5.0 million, a decrease in operating costs of$0.9 million and a decrease in statutory costs of $0.8 million. Factors contributing to the net increase include:

Impact of temporary initiatives:
* A $8.3 million increase in funding to support the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program;
* A $2.4 million increase in funding to support the spruce budworm outbreak intervention initiative – ACOA component;
* A $0.7 million decrease related to a reduction in the amount transferred from the department of National Defence in support of a project; and
* A $0.5 million decrease for the conclusion of operational funding for the administration of the Building Canada Fund.


Impact of other adjustments:
* A $5.0 million decrease related to changes in collections from repayable contributions;
* A $0.8 million decrease in statutory costs; and
* A $0.4 million decrease for Budget 2016 reduction on professional services, travel and advertising.


In 2017-18, the Agency will invest in the innovation and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in Atlantic Canada, accelerate
clean growth, and maximize international business opportunities. ACOA will continue to develop and diversify communities, and
strengthen community planning and capacity-building to stimulate transformative change. The Agency will provide evidence-based
policy-making, implement the Atlantic Growth Strategy in collaboration with the four Atlantic provincial governments and other federal
departments and stakeholders and support long-term growth in Atlantic Canada by facilitating a whole-of-government approach.

60,"dept","AECB","2017-18","2017-18","EST_PROC","The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is estimating budgetary expenditures of $136.9 million in 2017–18. Of this amount, $37.9 million requires approval by Parliament. The remaining $99.0 million represents statutory forecasts that do not require additional approval and are provided for informational purposes.


The CNSC has statutory authority – pursuant to paragraph 21(3) of the _Nuclear Safety and Control Act_ (NSCA) – to spend during a fiscal year any revenues that it receives in the current or previous fiscal year through the conduct of its operations. The CNSC receives its revenues from regulatory fees for licenses and applications charged in accordance with the _CNSC Cost Recovery Fees Regulations_.


In addition to the statutory authority, the CNSC is also funded through the voted budgetary authority from Parliament – Vote 1 – Program expenditures. Voted authority provides funding for activities exempt from paying fees under the _CNSC Cost Recovery Fees Regulations_ (i.e., hospitals and universities), as these entities exist for the public good. Additionally, fees are not charged for activities that result from Canada's obligations that do not provide a direct benefit to identifiable licensees. These include activities with respect to Canada's international obligations (including non-proliferation activities), public responsibilities such as emergency management and public information programs, and the updating of the NSCA and its associated regulations.


In 2017–18, the CNSC's Main Estimates have increased by $0.7 million or 0.6% when compared to the 2016–17 Main Estimates. The increase is due to a $1.5 million increase in Statutory expenditures resulting from an overall increase in projected expenditures due to salary increases. It is also attributable to an increase in revenues earned from formula fees, as a result of a phased-in review of formulas used with the _CNSC Cost Recovery Fees Regulations_, to align costs with regulatory activities for the various licence types. The increase in Statutory expenditures is partially offset by a decrease in Program expenditures of $0.8 million; of which $0.5 million is attributable to the sunset of funding associated with the single window horizontal initiative outlined in Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness (also known as the Beyond the Border Action Plan). The balance of $0.3 million is a result of Budget 2016 reductions related to professional services, travel and advertising.

61,"dept","AECL","2017-18","2017-18","EST_PROC","AECL delivers its mandate through a Government-owned, Contractor-operated model. Under this model, AECL's sites, facilities and assets are managed and operated by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories. 


Starting in 2016–17, AECL received all funding necessary to deliver on its mandate through the Main Estimates. This differs from previous years, when AECL received funding from a variety of sources, including Main and Supplementary Estimates, transfers from Natural Resources Canada and, occasionally Treasury Board Central Votes. This explains, in part, the variance between the amounts noted under 2015–16 Expenditures and 2017–18 Main Estimates presented in this document.


Funding for 2017–18 has been grouped into a single program area: Facilities and Nuclear Operations, which includes all funding to enable AECL to deliver on its mandate. As noted in its Corporate Plan Summary, AECL focusses its activities in two main areas:


Decommissioning and Waste Management $520.1 million
The objective is to safely and efficiently reduce the Government of Canada's radioactive waste liabilities, including associated risks to health, safety, security and the environment. The focus is on enabling Canadian Nuclear Laboratories to significantly advance infrastructure decommissioning, site remediation and waste management for Canada. Funding for these activities was previously provided through Natural Resources Canada's Nuclear Legacy Liabilities Program, the Port Hope Area Initiative and the Low-level Radioactive Waste Management Office, and as such, would not have been reflected in Parliamentary Appropriations to AECL prior to 2016–17. Starting in 2016–17, all funding for these activities is being provided directly to AECL through the Main Estimates, with increased funding to accelerate work that will reduce risks and discharge Canada's radioactive waste liabilities faster.


Nuclear Laboratories $450.9 million
The objective is to enable the effective implementation of the Government-owned, Contractor operated model and thereby enable Canadian Nuclear Laboratories to manage and operate AECL's sites efficiently and effectively to provide  expertise, products and services, and science and technology capabilities in support of: (i) Canada's federal roles, responsibilities and priorities; (ii) commercial services for third parties; and, (iii) capital projects and other corporate activities at the nuclear laboratories. Work in this activity includes renewal and modernization of the Chalk River site to enhance Canadian Nuclear Laboratories' ability to provide safe and world-class science and technology and other services for Canada.

Of this amount, $945.9 million is voted funding which requires approval by Parliament. The remaining $1.3 billion represents statutory forecasts that do not require additional approval and are provided for information only.


Most of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's funding supports programs under Growing Forward 2, a five-year (2013–18) policy framework by federal, provincial and territorial governments for Canada's agricultural and agri-food sector. Growing Forward 2 supports strategic investments that promote innovation, competitiveness and market development initiatives to help producers meet rising demand, both in Canada and internationally, while continuing to proactively manage risk. A significant portion of this $3 billion dollar investment is in the form of grants and contributions.


Compared to 2016–17, the Main Estimates have decreased by $12.5 million. Notable changes include:
* A decrease of $6.0 million in contributions to employee benefits plans as a result of a change in the established rate for 2017–18;
* A planned decrease of $4.6 million due to the sunsetting of the Churchill Port Utilization Program;
* $4.5 million transfer to Western Economic Diversification in support of the Saskatchewan Canadian Cattlemen's Association project under the Western Diversification Program;
* A decrease of $3.9 million related to planned government wide spending reductions, as announced in Budget 2016;
* A decrease of $1.7 million for the Federal Infrastructure Initiative;
* An increase of $4.6 million to support genomics, digitization and data mobilization of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada biological collections, as announced in Budget 2016; and

CATSA's 2017–18 Main Estimates for operating expenditures of $471.4 million are equivalent to its 2016–17 Main Estimates and represent CATSA's A-Base funding.


CATSA's 2017–18 Main Estimates for capital expenditures of $113.2 million are $39.4 million or approximately 26% lower than its 2016–17 Main Estimates of $152.6 million. The year-over-year variance in CATSA's capital budget envelope reflects lower cash flow requirements for 2017–18 to support the deployment of its new Hold Baggage Screening system as part of a 10-year capital life-cycle management plan. The variance is also attributable to a decrease in planned capital spending for Pre-Board Screening associated with the deployment of advanced technology and CATSA's life-cycle management plan.


As set out in its 2016–17 to 2020–21 Corporate Plan, CATSA's funding priorities for the 2017–18 fiscal year will continue to focus on the delivery of its core mandated activities. This includes the ongoing deployment of CATSA's new Hold Baggage Screening system at airports across Canada as part of its capital life-cycle management plan and enhancement of select Pre-Board Screening checkpoints to improve the passenger experience.

The CDC is directly involved in the administration of two of the three pillars (production management and price setting) via the establishment of industrial milk quota and support price.


The CDC administers the three revenue pooling and market sharing pools that exist among milk producers. Monthly, the CDC receives data from provincial milk marketing boards and calculates the payment transfers between provinces to equalize returns and adjusts quota allocations to provinces to account for the sharing of markets.


The CDC operates several programs for the benefit of the dairy industry. The Domestic Seasonality Programs ensure a steady supply of dairy products on the Canadian market. The Surplus Removal Programs ensure that milk components for which there is no outlet on the domestic market are removed in a timely fashion. Finally, the Matching Investment Fund and the Dairy Innovation program promote growth and innovation in the manufacture and use of dairy products and components. In addition, the CDC, on behalf of the industry, administers the Special Milk Class Permit Program (SMCPP) and the Dairy Export Program (DEP). The parameters of these programs are decided by the industry. 


The CDC imports the tariff rate quota of butter and sells this butter to participants in the SMCPP through butter manufacturers. Profits that the CDC generates by this activity are used to finance initiatives that provide benefits to the industry. An example of these initiatives is the Dairy Research Cluster.


The CDC also controls the subsidized exports of Canadian dairy products through the issuance of export permits. This permit system has been put in place to ensure that Canadian exports of dairy products do not exceed the limits imposed on Canada by the World Trade Organization (WTO) for subsidized exports.


To stimulate investments and growth in the use of Canadian milk and dairy ingredients, the CDC created the program Milk Access for Growth.


Producers and processors announced in July 2016 the successful conclusion of negotiations to evolve the Canadian dairy system for the future. The CDC is currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of this strategy on the programs it administers."

The Board of Trustees updated the Museum's goals based on the lessons learned in the first two years of operations. The updated goals will guide Museum operations and activities through the CMHR's upcoming five years of operations. These goals will serve as a roadmap in five strategic areas – visitor experience, audience reach, recognized leader, financial sustainability and people. 


The Board and Executive of the CMHR are committed to building on the Museum's considerable successes. A defining hallmark of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is its ability to inspire future generations. The Museum plans to expand its reach across Canada and the world, and to continually refresh and evolve exhibits, content and programming to ensure offerings remain impactful and relevant. 


The Museum will continue in its efforts to maximize the net income from admissions, membership, programs, retail, facility rentals and commissions from the bistro and catering. Working with the Friends of CMHR, the Museum plans to develop and implement a sponsorship strategy to supplement appropriations and earned revenue. 


Using business improvement methodologies, the Museum will review work processes to identify any overlap or redundancy in current processes and implement opportunities for continuous improvements.


Depending on long-term funding, the Museum plans to expand its remote and web based offerings; ensure the exhibits remain current and relevant to visitors; launch a travelling exhibits program; bring temporary exhibits from other institutions to CMHR, tailoring them to align with the CMHR mandate; continue to be innovative; expand linkages nationally and internationally to continue to contribute to increased economic benefits for Winnipeg, Manitoba and Canada; develop new and nationally relevant learning resources; and launch the National Student Program. Funding to CMHR was increased through federal Budget 2016, including ongoing funding for Payments in lieu of Taxes (PILT) and funding for priority capital requirements largely related to health and safety and the recapitalization of digital hardware and software."

Main Estimates planned budgetary expenditures were $432.4 million in 2016–17 representing a net decrease of $78.6 million between fiscal years 2016–17 and 2017–18. This corresponds to a decrease in Operating expenditures of $23.2 million, a decrease in Capital expenditures of $69.7 million and an increase in Grants and Contributions of $15.2 million. These fluctuations are mainly due to the fact that CSA's projects and missions funding profile vary from year to year and require funding from different Votes depending on their development phases. As a result, pre and post-project expenditures are Operating expenditures whereas the design and build phases call for Capital expenditures. In addition, the science support associated with some projects may necessitate funds either in Operating expenditures or in Grants and Contributions.

The increase of $681.3 million in statutory votes is mainly due to:
* Canada Health Transfer – An increase of $1.1 billion reflecting the annual increased funding commitment in the _Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act_, 2012. Starting in 2017–18, the CHT grows based on a three-year moving average of nominal gross domestic product growth, with funding guaranteed to increase by at least 3 per cent per year.

* Fiscal Equalization – An increase of $373.2 million reflecting the 2.09% gross domestic product-based escalator being applied to the 2016–17 level;
* Territorial Financing – An increase of $145.5 million as a result of new and updated data used to calculate territorial expenditure requirements and revenue capacities entering the formula for Territorial Formula Financing;
* Alternative Payments for Standing Programs – A decrease in recoveries in the amount of $20.5 million as a result of a decrease in the value of personal income tax points that were transferred to Quebec;
* Purchase of Domestic Coinage – An increase of $8.0 million due to proposed amendments to the _Royal Canadian Mint Act_, which repealed the stipulation that the Mint cannot anticipate profit with respect to the provision of circulation coins;
* Youth Allowance Recovery – A decreased recovery of $2.0 million as a result of a decrease in the estimated value of personal income tax points that were transferred to Quebec;
* Additional Fiscal Equalization Offset Payment to Nova Scotia – A decrease of $13.3 million due to the decline in offshore oil and gas revenues received by Nova Scotia. The Nova Scotia 2005 offshore arrangement guarantees that the province's offshore oil and gas revenues that enter the Equalization formula do not impact Equalization payments. Consequently, the province receives payments equal to the decline in Equalization due to these revenues;
* Additional Fiscal Equalization to Nova Scotia – A decrease of $43.9 million due to new data entering the formula, which is an average of data for three fiscal years. This program ensures that there is no reduction in combined Equalization and 2005 Offshore Accord Offset Payments relative to the previous Equalization formula (pre-2007);
* Other Interest Costs – A decrease of $528.0 million reflecting forecasted long-term bond rates by private sector economists in the 2016 Fall Economic Statement, which affects the average long-term bond rate that is used to calculate interest on the public sector pension obligations pertaining to services pre-April 1, 2000; and
* Interest on Unmatured Debt – A decrease of $764.0 million due to a downward revision of interest rates by private sector economists for 2017–18, consistent with the 2016 Fall Economic Statement.


The decrease of $1.5 million in Vote 1, Program expenditures is mainly due to a decrease in funding for:

Of the total amount of planned expenditures, $2.4 billion requires approval from Parliament. The remaining $55.0 billion represents statutory forecasts that do not require additional approval and are provided for information purposes.


The 2017–18 planned expenditures represent a decrease of $2.2 billion, or approximately 4%, when compared to the 2015–16 actual budgetary expenditures of $59.6 billion. The decrease is partly explained by a decrease in Universal Child Care Benefit, replaced by the new Canada Child Benefit. The decrease is offset by an increase to Old Age Security Pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement payments resulting from the aging population and the planned increase in the average monthly benefit amount.


When compared to the 2016–17 budgetary Main Estimates of $61.6 billion, the 2017–18 planned expenditures represent a decrease of $4.2 billion, primarily associated with statutory items. In particular, Universal Child Care Benefit represents a decrease of $7.7 billion. This significant decrease is offset by increases to the following items:
* An increase of $2.8 billion to Old Age Security Pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement payments explained by changes in the average monthly rate and in the number of beneficiaries;
* An increase of $461.5 million to the Canada Student Loans and Grants for Students and Apprentices Program, mostly explained by an increase to Canada Student Grants as a result of Budget 2016 measures to make post-secondary education more affordable for low- and middle-income families; and
* A $107.0 million increase to the Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds, which is due to a steady increase in total registered Canada Disability Savings Plans and participation in the program.


The Department plans to spend $576.8 million in 2017–18 in net operating expenditures (Vote 1), representing a decrease of $31.2 million from the 2016–17 Main Estimates of $608.0 million. The net decrease is mainly related to a reduction in resources for the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.


Voted grants and contributions (Vote 5) are expected to reach $1.8 billion in 2017–18, an increase of $154.1 million from the 2016–17 Main Estimates. The increase is mainly attributable to investments announced in Budget 2016 to the Canada Summer Jobs and the Homelessness Partnering Strategy.


In relation to non-budgetary loans, there is a net decrease in authorities of $621.2 million from the 2016–17 Main Estimates, mainly as a result of Budget 2016 measures which increase grants and reduce the disbursement of loans as more borrowers will have their financial needs met by the increase in grants."

The key priorities for Statistics Canada are ensuring its products continue to meet the needs of Canadians; filling high priority data gaps, continuing to increase the efficiency of its operations and fostering an environment of innovation.


Main Estimates planned expenditures (net of revenue) were $751.5 million for 2016–17 and $471.1 million in 2017–18. The decrease of $280.4 million is mainly attributable to:
* A decrease of $309.9 million for the 2016 Census of Population as the program begins to wind down. Applicable funding in 2017–18 will be used largely to complete processing of returns, continue data quality studies, disseminate results, and to complete evaluations of the 2016 Census of Population;
* A decrease of $12.1 million for the 2016 Census of Agriculture which reflects the end of the major period of collection and processing. The funding in 2017–18 will be used to disseminate the data, conduct evaluation studies, conduct content consultations with users to determine data needs for the 2021 cycle and link the 2016 Census of Agriculture with the 2016 Census of Population as well as with tax data to produce a rich and detailed database of socio-economic information on farm operators and their families;
* An increase of $32.4 million related to an out-of-court settlement. This settlement will see retroactive wage adjustment payments made to current and former employees of Statistical Survey Operations;
* A decrease of $3.3 million for the Survey of Financial Security and the annual household wealth distribution tables as the data collection portion of the project was completed in 2016-17. Funding for 2017-18 will be focused on processing, analysis and data dissemination. In addition, planning for the next cycle will begin; and 
* An increase of $2.5 million to enhance Canada's financial and wealth statistics for improved financial system surveillance and economic policy development.

Operating
Planned spending is expected to increase mostly as a result of Budget 2016 funding for such initiatives as enhancing the safety of railways and the transportation of dangerous goods, funding related to the assessment, management and remediation of federal contaminated sites, funding to address climate change and air pollution, and increased funding for the Port Asset Transfer Program.

Planned spending is expected to decrease in this vote under the Gateways and Border Crossings Fund and the Asia Pacific Gateway and Corridor Transportation Infrastructure Fund as these programs approach their maturity dates.


Grants and contributions - Transportation infrastructure
Planned spending is expected to increase in this vote mostly as a result of increased funding for the Port Asset Transfer Program and cash flow changes in the Outaouais Road Development Agreement.

Planned spending is expected to decrease slightly in this vote as a result of sunsetting funding for the Smart Oceans Contribution Program and decreased funding for the Community Participation Funding Program as this program approaches its maturity date. These decreases are partially offset by an increase in funding for rail safety programs which includes the consolidation of various rail programs into one Rail Safety Improvement Program.

Total planned spending for the 2017–18 fiscal year is $4.69 billion. Over 90% of VAC's budget, ($4.4 billion or 93.6%) represents payments to Veterans, their families and other program recipients.


As of March 2016 it is estimated there are approximately 670,100 Veterans nationwide. Only about 69,700 of them are war-service Veterans and, with an average age of 91 years, their numbers grow smaller with each passing month. At the same time, Canadian Armed Forces or modern-day Veterans are turning to VAC for help in growing numbers.


In comparison with the 2016–17 fiscal year, VAC's Main Estimates are increasing by 29.3% ($1.06 billion) in 2017–18. Over eighty percent of this increase is related to the Budget 2016 commitment to restore critical access to services for Veterans, as well as to ensure the long-term financial security of disabled Veterans.

As a complement, organizations are required to indicate the alignment of their programs to a set of 16 high-level Government of Canada activity areas within four Government of Canada spending areas: 
* Economic Affairs, 
* Social Affairs,
* International Affairs and, 
* Government Affairs. 

For the purposes of the InfoBase, Internal Services and Crown Corporations are presented as areas of government spending.


**Alignment of program to high-level Government of Canada activities **

Departments and agencies are required to indicate the alignment of programs to the Government of Canada high-level activities. Because this alignment is intended to make it possible to calculate spending by activity, while correctly totaling all government spending, a program can only be aligned to one Government of Canada major activity. A Core Responsibility and a Strategic Outcome, however, can contribute to more than one activity.
