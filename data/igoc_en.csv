In order to accomplish its core responsibility, which is economic development in Quebec, CED fosters business start-ups and growth. It helps them become more innovative, productive and competitive. It supports efforts to engage the regions of Quebec and attract investments that will help boost the economic well-being of Quebec and Canada.



CED contributes to the economic vitality of all of Quebec’s regions by leveraging their competitive regional advantages, such as wind power and marine technologies. It also supports the transition and diversification of communities that remain dependent on a limited number of sectors or that have been affected by an economic shock, such as the closure of the chrysotile mines.



CED achieves its results by supporting businesses, primarily SMEs, and non-profit organizations (NPOs), through strategic investments.
