The Recreational Fisheries Conservation Partnerships Program encourages a partnership-based approach through the provision of funding to recreational fisheries and conservation groups to undertake habitat restoration activities.

By providing access, LAC contributes to creating new knowledge that will increase the understanding of Canadian society. This program includes the activities through which documentary heritage is digitized, described, organized, indexed and interlinked to facilitate access and meets the needs and expectations of users. The resulting digital content, databases, catalogue indexes and other tools assist users in searching the records for which LAC is responsible. The program also encompasses all activities to make documentary heritage available, in particular through the website and onsite. LAC provides information as well as consultation, reproduction and lending services in various forms to a wide range of users. These services are provided in many ways—in person, by telephone, by mail, via email or over the Internet—based on needs and preferences. LAC also contributes to making Canada's documentary heritage known by providing access to records under its responsibility through public programming and partnerships. The Documentary Heritage Communities Program is a contribution program that ensures the preservation of Canada's local documentary heritage, provides access to and promotes local documentary heritage communities; and provides opportunities to evolve and remain sustainable. Lastly, LAC contributes significantly by providing access to government records for which it has responsibility under the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act and by providing information found in the personnel files of former civil service employees and members of the Canadian Forces.",0,0,0,0

Results are achieved through this Program by the application of Defence capabilities in domestic, continental and international domains, either independently or in combination with allies, where the primary focus is to inflict military effects against threats. The term Defence capability is a collective term that refers to the ability of a military force to achieve a desired effect against a threat during the execution of a Defence operation (or the delivery of a Defence service) by executing tasks according to understood concepts, doctrine and standards. The military forces delivered by Defence are composed of force elements which are organizational entities that are, in turn, composed of members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and in some cases personnel from the Department of National Defence. Force elements integrate people, with specialized information and expertise, materiel (e. g. , equipment, platforms, weapon systems) and in some cases real property, so that capabilities can be applied against threats. Force elements have different sizes and compositions according to the capabilities they must apply during an operation. This Program is underpinned by the National Defence Act, defence policy, international treaties and agreements, membership in international organizations, and direction received by the Government of Canada. Sub-programs beneath this Program target a range of threats across a variety of operational contexts via different delivery mechanisms in different geographic regions.",0,0,0,0

Defence unique services also include operations conducted to ensure or enhance the security, safety, stability and/or well-being of Canadians, or international populations in peril, in accordance with Canadian values and the interests of the Canadian Government, in situations where there may be a need to defend against armed threats but where this is not the primary focus. The operations are delivered through the employment of force elements to achieve a desired effect within specific contexts through execution of tasks according to understood concepts, doctrine and standards. The force elements delivered by Defence are organizational entities which are composed of members of the Canadian Armed Forces and in some cases personnel from the Department of National Defence.

Results are delivered by assembling force elements from the fundamental elements of Defence capability (i.e. , military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and, in some cases, real property), and integrating them through various training and certification programs so that they have the requisite amount of readiness in order to fulfill predefined roles within the operations for which they are destined. The term readiness refers to the volume, endurance, responsiveness and capability attributes of force elements that are not employed. These attributes are used to determine the degree of risk that would be associated with assigning them to fulfill perspective role(s) within on-going or contingency operations. The force elements produced by the Defence Ready Force Elements Production Program are organized into portfolios according to the land, aerospace, and maritime environments in which they operate. There are also portfolios for force elements that operate jointly across these domains and force elements that provide common support functions. Across these portfolios, force elements are produced to meet readiness targets. These readiness targets ensure that production can be sustained over short- and medium-term time horizons and that the number of force elements available for employment in on-going and contingency operations is in accordance with acceptable levels of operational risk.",0,0,0,0

The primary elements of Defence capability are military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and real property. A fundamental focus of the Defence Capability Elements Production Program is to provide an adequate and sustained supply of individual military personnel and materiel in the near-term and over long-term time horizons so that they can be integrated to produce force elements within the Defence Ready Force Element Production Program. Results are achieved through subordinate programs, each of which focuses on a separate portfolio: military personnel and organization; materiel; real property; or information systems. A lifecycle approach is used to manage each portfolio. The essential aspects of the lifecycle approach are sub-sub-programs that provide the principle lifecycle functions: introduction into service; maintenance, upgrade and supply; release from service; portfolio management; and overarching co-ordination and control. The character of activity that occurs within each of these primary functions depends on the portfolio of entities being produced and therefore the de-segregation of the lifecycle functions into sub-sub-programs is unique to each portfolio.

Results are achieved by: establishing and monitoring the fulfillment of near-term targets for readying force elements and conducting Defence operations; identifying lessons from past operations; assessing defence and security trends; developing and integrating new knowledge and systems/methods for conducting operations; developing approaches and conducting Defence capability analyses at strategic, operational and tactical levels; present to future capability assessments; designing and assessing defence alternatives; providing Defence capability oversight and expertise; and Defence capability use planning for sustainable Defence capabilities in future time horizons.
