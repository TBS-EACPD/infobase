Results are achieved through this Program by the application of Defence capabilities in domestic, continental and international domains, either independently or in combination with allies, where the primary focus is to inflict military effects against threats. The term Defence capability is a collective term that refers to the ability of a military force to achieve a desired effect against a threat during the execution of a Defence operation (or the delivery of a Defence service) by executing tasks according to understood concepts, doctrine and standards. The military forces delivered by Defence are composed of force elements which are organizational entities that are, in turn, composed of members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and in some cases personnel from the Department of National Defence. Force elements integrate people, with specialized information and expertise, materiel (e. g. , equipment, platforms, weapon systems) and in some cases real property, so that capabilities can be applied against threats. Force elements have different sizes and compositions according to the capabilities they must apply during an operation. This Program is underpinned by the National Defence Act, defence policy, international treaties and agreements, membership in international organizations, and direction received by the Government of Canada.

The CPI affects the standard of living and the financial security of virtually all Canadians. Anyone who has ever paid taxes, paid rent, had a cost-of-living wage increase or taken out a loan has been affected by the CPI. Public and private sector organizations use the CPI to escalate a wide variety of salaries, pensions, transfer payments and expenditures to ensure that purchasing power is maintained over time. The CPI also influences the rate of interest Canadians pay on their mortgages and consumer loans. The Bank of Canada uses other key economic indicators as inputs to our country’s monetary policy to ensure that interest rates remain low, stable and predictable. This allows Canadians to make spending and investment decisions with more confidence, encourages longer-term investment in Canada’s economy, and contributes to sustained job creation and greater productivity. Statistics Canada also produces environmental statistics that can be linked to economic data.
