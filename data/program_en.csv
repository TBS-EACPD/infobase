The BMC is self-contained and is managed and operated by a not-for-profit (NFP) entity to fulfill its public good mandate. The NRC leases the facility to this organization and provides $17 million per year through a contribution agreement to offset facility operational costs. While the BMC outputs and outcomes are not directly under control of the NRC, its performance is monitored to ensure effective stewardship of Government funds.



The BMC was built by the NRC to provide Canada with a domestic vaccine production capacity, and the ability to produce, especially in times of need in the supply chain. In non-pandemic periods, the BMC provides domestic capacity to undertake public interest projects, such as the production of orphan drugs for rare diseases, to support improved health outcomes for Canadians and protect those at high risk. The BMC may also provide domestic biomanufacturing GMP production for universities and SMEs, to contribute to the sector’s growth, knowledge and capacity.



Given the NFP arrangement that is being put in place, the long-term role of the NRC will be to provide effective oversight of the contribution agreement between the BMC and the NRC and to see that the objectives of the BMC are being realized.",0,1,0,0

The Centre also supports the development, growth, competitiveness and resiliency of Canada’s semiconductor industry, as well as emerging needs from key sectors of the economy (e.g., telecom/datacom, AI/high performance computing, quantum). The Centre applies cutting-edge expertise to Canadian industries for the design, prototype testing and validation of technology solutions to give them a competitive edge for new market opportunities and growth. The Centre reduces start-up and product development costs, and de-risks technology for client firms and venture capital investors, which is helping Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises grow and increase Canadian share in the semiconductor market. The Centre also provides multi-disciplinary collaborative research and development services in addition to specialized technical services in state-of-the-art facilities.
