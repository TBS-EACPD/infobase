IRCC issues permanent resident documentation to approved applicants. Government-assisted refugees are identified by the United Nations Refugee Agency and are entirely supported by the Canadian or Quebec government for one year. This assistance includes the provision of income supports, funding of immediate settlement needs (such as accommodation) and loans for transportation to Canada. Refugees can also be privately sponsored by Canadian community organizations or groups of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. The private sponsor is responsible for providing financial support, orientation services, assistance with accommodations, and emotional and social support for one year, or until the individual is self-supporting. A refugee may also be accepted as a blended visa office-referred applicant where the Government of Canada and a private sponsor share the costs and responsibilities of sponsorship.

"CI","CI-BGE00","BGE06","Asylum",,"IRCC is accountable for overall delivery of the in-Canada asylum system by which foreign nationals may seek protection from within Canada. An individual can make a claim for protection to either the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) at a port of entry, or to IRCC or CBSA at an inland office. Officers assess whether a claimant is eligible to make a claim and, if so, the claim is referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). The IRB is an independent administrative tribunal that determines the validity of every claim. A positive decision leads to “protected person” status and the possibility of applying for permanent residence. Protected persons are entitled to receive settlement services as available under IRCC’s Settlement Program, and are eligible for temporary health-care coverage. A negative decision leads to various appeal mechanisms. Once appeals are exhausted, individuals are given 30 days to leave Canada voluntarily. After this period, failed claimants are removed from Canada. In most cases, a pre-removal risk assessment is conducted to ensure claimants are not removed to face persecution, danger of torture or risk to life.

Results are delivered by assembling force elements from the fundamental elements of Defence capability (i.e. , military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and, in some cases, real property), and integrating them through various training and certification programs so that they have the requisite amount of readiness in order to fulfill predefined roles within the operations for which they are destined.

These attributes are used to determine the degree of risk that would be associated with assigning them to fulfill perspective role(s) within on-going or contingency operations.

The primary elements of Defence capability are military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and real property. A fundamental focus of the Defence Capability Elements Production Program is to provide an adequate and sustained supply of individual military personnel and materiel in the near-term and over long-term time horizons so that they can be integrated to produce force elements within the Defence Ready Force Element Production Program. Results are achieved through subordinate programs, each of which focuses on a separate portfolio: military personnel and organization; materiel; real property; or information systems.

The essential aspects of the lifecycle approach are sub-sub-programs that provide the principle lifecycle functions: introduction into service; maintenance, upgrade and supply; release from service; portfolio management; and overarching co-ordination and control.

Several of these indicators are used directly to set fiscal and monetary policy. One of these indicators is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI affects the standard of living and the financial security of virtually all Canadians. Anyone who has ever paid taxes, paid rent, had a cost-of-living wage increase or taken out a loan has been affected by the CPI. Public and private sector organizations use the CPI to escalate a wide variety of salaries, pensions, transfer payments and expenditures to ensure that purchasing power is maintained over time. The CPI also influences the rate of interest Canadians pay on their mortgages and consumer loans. The Bank of Canada uses other key economic indicators as inputs to our country’s monetary policy to ensure that interest rates remain low, stable and predictable. This allows Canadians to make spending and investment decisions with more confidence, encourages longer-term investment in Canada’s economy, and contributes to sustained job creation and greater productivity. Statistics Canada also produces environmental statistics that can be linked to economic data. This includes tracking the water, energy and greenhouse gas emission intensities produced by different industries within the Canadian economy, and by governments and households.
