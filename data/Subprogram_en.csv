Activities include conserving populations, individual birds, and their nests and eggs, as well as efforts to conserve habitats of importance to birds. One of the key activities undertaken in this program is monitoring the status and trends of the wide diversity of bird species, as well as the broad range of landscapes where they occur. Another key component of the program is to undertake research to understand causes of change in bird populations in order to inform future conservation actions, whether for species below accepted targets or for species above their targets (e.g., overabundant species). Conservation actions—both within Canada and in other countries that share responsibility for migratory birds—are undertaken on the basis of the results of the monitoring programs and are informed by the results of research. Conservation actions include the promotion of management practices and stewardship actions that protect and conserve birds and their habitats, mitigation of stressors/factors that affect the population status of birds (including actions on habitats of importance to birds), development of policies and guidance to support the conservation of birds while also minimizing socio-economic impacts of birds (including managing health and safety issues associated with migratory birds), and taking actions to enforce the Act and associated regulations.

Prevention involves providing expert advice to proponents of large development projects through the environmental assessment process and regulating chemical facilities to develop and implement environmental emergency plans. Effective preparedness is built on role clarity, effective decision making and communication, and trust and cooperation among government, industry and communities. During an emergency response, the National Environmental Emergencies Centre is Environment and Climate Change Canada’s focal point for provision of scientific advice, such as weather forecasting, contaminant trajectory modelling, the fate and behaviour of hazardous substances, sensitivity mapping, the establishment of clean up priorities, and the protection of sensitive ecosystems and wildlife, such as migratory birds and species at risk, as well as the protection of culturally significant sites. Recovery activities include assessing damage and providing advice to polluters on repairing environments damaged by environmental emergencies.

Under situations that require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), employers are able to hire foreign workers as a last resort to meet their short-term or acute labour and skills needs when qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents are not available, ensuring that Canadians have the first opportunity for jobs where appropriate. To hire a temporary foreign worker to respond to labour market shortages, employers require an LMIA from Employment and Social Development Canada, which considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available, examines the wage and working conditions being offered, and assess whether the job offer would have a negative, neutral or positive effect on the Canadian labour market. Once the potential employer is in possession of the LMIA, the foreign national may then apply for the work permit at a mission abroad, at the port of entry (if eligible) or inside Canada (if eligible). In certain situations, employers can also seek to employ foreign nationals to work in Canada without an LMIA. Exemptions from the LMIA processes are offered where they support broader Canadian interests such as the competitive advantages and reciprocal benefits that Canadians enjoy as a result of international agreements and partnerships (including North America Free Trade Agreement and others).
