HI01,Addressing Air Pollution,"Air pollution threatens the health of Canadians, degrades the environment, and can reduce economic productivity. It is linked with increased incidences of stroke, heart disease and acute respiratory diseases, and it exacerbates conditions such as asthma and diabetes, with subsequent increases in hospital admissions, emergency room visits and premature mortality. Outdoor air pollution also affects wildlife, ecosystems and vegetation, structures, and leads to reduced visibility. Indoor air pollution exposure is of particular concern given Canadians spend approximately 90% of their time indoors. Health Canada estimates that air pollution from human sources results in 14,500 premature deaths every year in Canada and contributes to 3 million days of asthma symptoms among asthmatics and 16 million days of breathing difficulty and reduced activity in non-asthmatics every year. These health impacts are valued at over $110 billion per year. This initiative aims to improve air quality and health in Canada, and provide Canadians with the tools to make informed decisions to reduce their exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants. Activities to be undertaken include: 1.Scientific and reporting activities to provide the foundation for credible, relevant and timely policy and regulation development, administration, and enforcement; and to provide air quality information to Canadians. 2.Policy and analysis activities to provide the strategic advice and economic and health benefit analysis necessary to develop effective policy and regulatory measures; to continue to work with provinces, territories and other stakeholders to address domestic air pollution, and to continue working with the U.S. under the bilateral Air Quality Agreement and with other countries in international fora such as the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to reduce transboundary sources of air pollution. 3.Mitigation actions for outdoor air quality include developing and implementing new regulatory and non-regulatory instruments to reduce emissions from industrial, transportation and consumer products sectors and equipment types, and continuing to administer and update existing instruments. 4.Mitigation actions for indoor air quality include communication and outreach activities through HC's and NRC's indoor air quality programs to inform Canadians of the health risks of indoor air pollution and to encourage personal actions to reduce these risks in homes and buildings, including at schools and workplaces.",EC,4,2016,3,2021,,,,5,2019,261436096,135000000,251126924,ECCC provides overall program coordination.

HI03,Major Projects Management Office Initiative,"Established in 2007 to improve the performance of the review process for major natural resource projects, the MPMOI is a horizontal initiative across 12 federal departments and agencies. The Initiative was renewed in 2015 for $135 million over five years to ensure: that Canada remains a competitive and attractive location to invest; high environmental standards are upheld; and meaningful Indigenous consultations are conducted. The Major Projects Deputy Ministers' Committee serves as the governance body for the implementation of the Cabinet Directive on Improving the Performance of the Regulatory System for Major Resource Projects.",NR,4,2007,3,2020,4,2010,10,13,2019,344936341,88756426,88756426,"The Cabinet Directive on Improving the Performance of the Regulatory System for Major Resource Projects establishes the governance framework for federal departments and agencies to facilitate the effective, coordinated and concurrent discharge of their statutory duties, functions and obligations related to the regulation of major resource projects. It encourages them to work together to identify areas where the federal regulatory system can be improved, and to drive system-wide improvements to the accountability, transparency, timeliness and predictability of the federal regulatory system for major resource projects. The Minister of Natural Resources is the lead minister for the MPMOI. He works with his counterparts to report to Cabinet on improvements to the federal review process and reports to Parliament and the public through NRCan’s Annual Report. The Major Projects Deputy Ministers' Committee governs the Initiative, providing direction to resolve project and policy matters in keeping with the Cabinet Directive. Members include Deputy Minister level representatives from: NRCan (Chair), Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada,  Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Health Canada, Justice, Privy Council Office, Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, and the National Energy Board. The Committee is supported by the MPMO officials who provide overarching management and coordination of the federal regulatory system for major resource projects, and deliver strategic policy advice, analysis and other information to support the sound functioning of this horizontal initiative. Interdepartmental working groups of MPMOI partners at the Assistant Deputy Minister, Director General and working levels meet regularly to advance the coherent delivery of the MPMO mandate.",
